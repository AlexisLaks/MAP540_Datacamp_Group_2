0,5,"I have used iPhones since VZW started supporting them with the iPhone 4. Later upgraded to a 5S, then a 6 Plus. They continued to get better and better. The Plus increase in size was welcomed, but with a durable case became too bulky to comfortably fit it in your pocket. The iPhone X FaceID when initially announced was not a reason to upgrade, however the accuracy, performance, and form factor make up for a great phone. Perfect size and excellent performance and features."
1,5,I held off purchasing the iPhone X until I had a chance to read early reviews and spend some hands on time with the device. I love having a larger screen in roughly the same device size as my iPhone 7. I DO NOT miss the home button!
2,5,I waited for this version to come out and love the additional features. I would purchase again and recommend to friends
3,5,Love my phone. Amazing camera and apps. Highly recommend
4,1,"This phone isn't worth the price tag. You are paying for face ID, which isn't as good as touch ID."
5,5,"I was hesitant about FaceID initially, but now that I’ve had my iPhone for a couple of months I love it! It’s fast an easy to use, within a few days I was past the fingerprint unlocking and home button."
6,5,Faster. Better battery life. Larger screen. Con: closing applications are similar to an android. No issues with face recognition.
7,5,Love love love this phone it is everything I needed in a phone
8,2,"For the first time in my life Im actually entertaining Galaxy phones. The problem I have with the X is there is no Finger Print anymore. Im always on the go, I usually wear sunglasses and this affects the face recognition.So I have to stop, stair at screen then swipe or if fails , type in 6 digit code. The display is dull and generally I think my 6S Plus was more robust with clarity. The speakers are really good and the camera is well, B- or so. Video quality for youtubers might be ok as well. But Ive seen videos shot on S8 that are much clearer than my X can take video. The price also is ridiculous and not worth it. after 6 days of owning, Im taking it back and I will gladly pay the restock fee and either go back to my old 6S or try Galaxy S8+."
9,5,Great Phone. Replaced my iPhone 7 with the X. Nice camera.
10,4,"I enjoy how the phone is a large screen. The camera is amazing, I would enjoy it more if there was a plus but overall I love it."
11,5,"Danielle helped us with my iPhone x purchase. She was very knowledgeable about the product, very friendly and efficient."
12,4,Awesome phone.. but need the screen a bit bigger..
13,5,We love this phone. I phone never disappoints. Get one
14,5,Another great iPhone. The facial recognition to unlock it is great.
15,5,The phone took a little getting used to with no home button and the changes no home button brings! ....but now I love!
16,5,"With a bigger screen than the plus models and a smaller footprint. The new iPhone already had a lot going for it, then add wireless charging, face ID, and the new more powerful chip shared with the other models. You come up with the most advanced iPhone the world has seen. It feels good in the hands. A camera that has to be seen in action to fully appreciate the quality, agile transitions between apps, stereo speakers, and the apple eco system that unites all your apple devices all coming together to give you the experience that's worth the upgrade to the iPhone 10. I guess X really does mark the spot."
17,5,I am still getting used to the new phone but so far I love it. Having trouble right now getting emails but hope that can be fixed.
18,5,"This device is amazing, with so many great features."
19,5,The iphone X is a big step up from my iphone 7. I love the portrait mode additions and the face id is cool too! Love it!
20,5,This phone is awesome I didn’t think I would like the face rec features but it is cool...
21,5,Went into the store the morning of release just looking to upgrade to some 8+’s but someone in front of me didn’t want it because it was the wrong color so I snagged it. Battery and camera are great. Still learning all the “bells and whistles”
22,5,I really like everything on the new iPhone. So glad I upgraded
23,5,The iPhone X is the best phone I’ve ever used. The camera creates pictures similar to a professional photographer and the face recognition works even in the dark after the initial setup.
24,5,"Im an android guy, but I got this for my wife who is not so techy. She loves it and it works great. The technology is significantly behind android, but still a good phone."
25,5,Didn’t know how to feel with no home button but it’s refreshing
26,5,"IphoneX is living up to it's promise, my daughter loves it!"
27,5,The iPhone X is the best phone out there. The camera is great and the system is really smooth. Android fans could say wherever they want but the reality is just one. iPhone overall is the best!
28,5,I had a good experience with Apple iPhone X and it was great
29,5,"I love this phone, I am still learning the ins and outs like why I can’t view my messages with facial recognition but the iPhone X I bought from T-Mobile does it so not sure if I did something wrong upon set up"
30,5,Changed my iPhone 7 Plus for this one. It took couple of day to get used to new options
31,5,Great upgrade from 6 plus I don’t miss the size and you get used to the different way of maneuvering around the phone. Don’t miss the home button. For the price it should come with air pods.
32,5,"X gets Win! Great camera , love size and holds charge nicely"
33,5,This is by far the best phone I’ve ever had !! Camera is top notch from apple and in both directions or the X !! Don’t even miss home button ! Don’t be scared it’s the perfect size phone !
34,5,My son got the phone for Christmas absolutely loves everything about it. Great camera very sleek and a beauty
35,5,I really like what Apple has brought to the phone game.
36,5,"I had an iPhone 7 Plus, and upgraded to the iPhone X. It was a little hard at first to get used to a little smaller size and the face recognition. But it’s been a few weeks now, and I’m not sure how I could love with out it. Could be slightly larger but great phone."
37,5,Different from what I used too but overall a great phone. Bit of a learning curve tho but super worth it. Apple did great on this one.
38,4,"For this being a $1000 phone, the iPhone X is honestly nothing too special. All iPhones with the same software will feel the same. It is just the design that lures people in."
39,5,I love this phone. Don’t miss the home button one bit.
40,5,Best iPhone yet battery superb fast operating system very fluid feel .
41,5,But I really love it. I used to have a 6s plus because I like a bigger screen. This screen is just as big but the phone is not! Perfect
42,5,Had this phone about a month. No problems at all. I really like the screen and the functions. I would definitely recommend.
43,5,Fantastic. Couldn’t imagine iPhone without home button. But once I used got used to it
44,5,"Best iPhone ever!!! Not big, nice and sleek and yet has a full screen. Awesome"
45,5,I loved how the emojis can transforme into your own voice
46,4,Love the face recognition. The camera seems much better too.
47,5,Ok - the phone took some getting used to. Now that I have - I’d never go back! Awesome progress and this is where I’d expect us to be. Facial recognition... really?!?! Take my money.
48,5,My husband and I both got the iPhone X. We love it and would recommend it to anyone.
49,5,Both my husband and I got the iPhone X. We absolutely love them and would recommend them to anyone.
50,5,The best smart phone on the market there is. Love how all my data was transfered in a hearbeat! Just love it!!
51,5,Slightly heavier than my iPhone 6 but the facial recognition is great! Larger screen is great for watching videos
52,5,"Very fast phone, awesome canera. Great, light, flash is good"
53,5,"My wife loves the way our phones “work” again. Not a big fan of the way Apple nudged is into this purchase by slowing down our old phones, but this phone really is impressive!"
54,5,I am very impressed by the functionality and usefulness of the facial recognition technology as well as overall flow of this phone’s operational usefulness!
55,5,Fast service and the guy who helped me knew exactly how to explain all my questions
56,5,"I finally got this phone, and I love new experience."
57,5,It is amazing. Love it. Best and easiest phone ever.
58,5,Decided to upgrade from the 6s and I do not regret it. Don’t be afraid of the lack of the home button super easy to get used to.
59,5,I bought the iPhone X for my wife and she loves it. The screen is beautiful. The camera is stunning and the facial scanner is next level!
60,4,This was wonderful! I love the camera! I would recommend this product for anyone.
61,5,It took me a little bit to get used to the the changes. But when I got it down - OH MAN!! Love it ❤
62,5,"What a Fun, slim and has awesome camera with cute emoticons that talk... HaHa"
63,5,I don’t buy a phone very often but I have really enjoyed this phone. I really like the size without going to the Iphone Pluses.
64,5,Everything worked out on the new iPhone. It has a very good camera and great full size screen.
65,5,What a phone. Got it for my mother and she loves it.
66,5,"All my gadgets are from Apple. I have yet found anything wrong with their products. I find them a bit pricey but in the end, never regretting the purchase. Totally love the new iphone X and it’s features."
67,5,"I love the iPhone X, and the camera is amazing! The screen makes for a great experience, and it doesn’t feel too big."
68,5,"I upgraded from to the iPhone X, and it’s a fantastic phone! It has a huge screen, and it’s super easy to use!"
69,5,I love all the features of this phone. I would definitely recommend it
70,5,Like that the iPhone X is basically the same size the the standard iPhone but has the screen size of the iPhone plus. Only issue I’ve seen so far is that the Face ID is a little slow compared to the latest Touch ID.
71,4,"Design is great, the different controls are not difficult to learn, face ID is actually pretty rapid and will read you even in the dark.Mail app is a little wonky but probably software problem rather than phone"
72,4,The phone is faster and the battery life is great all else pretty much the same
73,5,This thing is awesome! Took a little while to adjust from my 7+ but still caught on easily!
74,5,"Good phone , camera, speed, Face ID , secured and Best Buyhas given a good deal."
75,5,Another great addition to our Apple family! We absolutely love all things Apple
76,5,This is a great phone. Compared to all the other phones the battery lasts so much longer which is a huge feature for me.
77,5,Couldn’t be happier with my purchase. Would buy again no doubt!
78,5,I absolutely love my iPhoneX and working with Best Buy was so great!
79,5,This is the best iPhone Apple has released yet!! It has so many new features that make using it an absolute pleasure.
80,4,Great service to order online and same day pick up item at local Best Buy especially the day before Christmas! Super awesome!
81,5,I am so glad I decided to upgrade to the iPhone X. I haven’t had any issues
82,5,This phone is very appealing to the eyes and an extremely smart phone. The facial recognition technology is pretty accurate and the picture taking features are incredible. Very happy with my purchase.
83,5,"As an iPhone user for many years I can say this version is good as most of the upgrades are, the only thing is that most apps still don’t have support for the faceid and loops themselves sometimes & if your life is attached to having a home button you’re going to crazy the 1st weeks trying to get used to it, so overall is good..: expensive but good"
84,5,"Great phone, features don’t disappoint. Wasn’t hard to transition from iPhone 7 Plus surprisingly. Portrait mode in camera is amazing!"
85,5,Great phone works well fast and love the features!!
86,5,"Love this phone it works great, it’s an iPhone :)!!"
87,3,Nothing really changed... not that impressed with the iPhoneX. The only pro about this phone is the camera.
88,5,I’ve had every single iPhone out there and this is the best one. Having no home buttons saves you a lot of issues. Well made product apple!
89,5,Great upgrade great product would recommend to all
90,3,The camera is great! The facial recognition software needs improvement. It doesn’t always work. The glass is not as durable as they claim. Put a case on it for sure.
91,5,"I've really enjoyed this phone since day one. It took about a day for the learning curve without a home button, but now it is second nature. I replaced a Galaxy S8+ that was buggy and crashed all the time. This phone takes great pics, has excellent battery life, and has worked flawlessly without crashing once. Great investment!"
92,5,Best iPhone yet. Love the facial recognition and long lasting battery
93,4,Face ID seems kind of a gimmick but the phone and the new screen is superb!
94,5,Replaced my iPhone 6 with the x and I love it!! Highly recommend!!
95,5,"Fast, smooth screen changes, ease of using keys. Recommend highly."
96,5,Loving my phone so far. I only upgraded because I needed more storage and a longer battery life and I’ve gotten than with my new iPhone X. The lack of a home button takes some getting used to be the battery is great!
97,5,This is the best iPhone I have had so far. The camera is great.
98,3,Th one thing that i dislike the most about this phone is the button that’s missing. How do you just simple go away from the one thing you’ve been doing since day 1. And the facial recognition camera goes out too much.
99,5,Best phone yet love it great pics too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
100,5,I got tried of android so i switched to an iphone and so far like it
101,5,"Coming from a Galaxy Device, I was questioning switching back to Apple. I think that the phone was amazing, and it is! The new IPS display has breathtaking colors, and the OS is just as easy to use as ever! Recommended!"
102,5,Love the new features and faster processing. Face recognition makes unlocking so much easier
103,5,I usually wait at least 2 years before upgrading my iPhone but this was the tenth anniversary and this didn't disappoint. Love the facial recognition and the camera is better than ever!
104,5,"I love my new iPhone! Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of things they need to upgrade and I don’t think it is worth the money, but overall, I’m happy."
105,5,"Best iPhone yet. It took a while to get used to not having a home button, but now I don’t even give it a second thought."
106,5,Bought it as a Christmas present. They apsolutely love their new phone
107,5,"Works as expected. Sync with my IPAD and MAC. With so many features, not all used yet, it will be a long time before I am comfortable with all of them. So far no issues with anything I have used"
108,4,"The screen is awesome and I’d call it perfect size. Don’t miss my 6s plus, but I miss my home button. Face ID is way better, but really just hate the app switcher. Phone is great, iOS needs some updates, hate app switcher"
109,4,"I have had at least six iPhones over the years. I upgraded to this phone from the iPhone 7 Plus. I like that the phone is smaller but the display is taller. However, the display is slightly narrower than the display on the 7 Plus. I miss the home button, but I adapted to that change quickly. Face recognition is convenient. I waited a couple of months before buying this phone so the kinks could be worked out. There have been no major glitches, but the phone does not process as quickly as it should. Overall, this is a good phone and lives up to iPhone expectations, but there is still room for improvement."
110,5,Excellent phone. My kids love it. Better phone than I have.
111,5,I have only great things to say about the iphone X. Super product all the way around
112,5,"I bought this phone for my son and he loves it, lots of new features, but he is most impressed with the face recognition and the speed."
113,5,Bought this phone for my wife for Xmas.... and she loves it a lot
114,5,This is so far the best phone in the market... very beautiful iPhone .
115,5,"Waited to get it and it was so worth it. The store in Henrietta,NY is the best"
116,5,This is by far my favorite phone I’ve had to date. Huge screen on a phone that still fits in my pocket.
117,5,I love the way they set up the face recognition I would recommend
118,5,Best iPhone so far...........well worth the money.
119,5,Love love this new Apple X iphone its perfect in every way
120,5,I appreciate the new phone and all it’s neew design Face ID is a game changer with Apple
121,3,"Don't get me wrong I am happy with my iphone. It's a beautiful phone but then it needs a case as it is all glass so you never really get to appreciate it's aesthetic beauty much. My absolute favorite thing about it is that the screen is the size of a 7 plus with a body the size of a 7. So I don't need to carry around an enormous phone for the screen size. The battery life is great and the camera takes beautiful photos compared to my 7! I also very much enjoy the facial recognition. My cons, not having a button makes things more difficult, I am constantly taking accidental screenshots while trying to ""wake up"" my phone, also closing apps is so much work now compared to before. The facial recognition only allows it to be set up with one user which to me is a drag as me and my fiance share our phones all the time, and even though we can type in the password, it's just another step backwards. Besides the things I've mentioned I don't see any other major differences between having a 7 and an X. I ended up upgrading after my 7 crashed (which I question now after the whole apple scandal), but if you still have a working 7 or 7 plus. Keep it."
122,5,Happiest girl in the world when my daughter got this iPhone. Does take a little adjustment time due to the change in home button and the visual lock - but very happy with the new features/function.
123,5,This is our second upgrade to the iPhone X. Nice phone - especially the screen size.
124,5,As good as advertised. My favorite iphone to date.
125,5,I have no idea yet how good is until it will pass any test.
126,5,If you are on the fence about upgrading to the iPhone X jump off! It really is the best iPhone They have ever released
127,5,I really like this phone especially the camera… I really can’t believe how clear the pictures are
128,5,"I went from the 7plus to the X and at first I thought I would hate the smaller phone, but it’s just the right size!!! I love all the new features and still figuring out all it can do!!!"
129,5,Wonderful camera and excellent size. Truly water proof he uses his music in shower!
130,5,"I had a 6. This is quite an upgrade. It took some getting used to not having a home button, but now I love it."
131,5,"This was my Christmas gift to me. Big clear screen. Great camera, amazing Apple quality."
132,5,"Fast, smooth as silk internet browsing. Best iPhone yet."
133,5,I absolutely 110% love this phone! The camera is awesome!
134,4,I got my model x with 256 gb phone 3 weeks ago and I liked this phone so far in terms of performance and easiness. As normal apple did a good job with this new model. I usually don’t write the reviews but this is the first time I am writing a review after 10 years. This is my Frank assessment on iPhone model x.you will not be disappointed with this buy.
135,5,excellent wireless telephone great quality picture
136,5,Once again Apple hits it out of the park with an iPhone!
137,5,"After having various iPhone models since 2007, I was pleasantly surprised by the iPhone X. I really like that this phone does not have a home button and that it has face recognition that works well. The phone is very fast also. Overall, I really think Apple did a great job on this phone and I have no regrets over what I originally considered to be a big expense for a phone."
138,5,I live my IPhone X! I’m so glad I did this purchase! It’s sleek and smart!
139,5,"This iPhone was a gift for my daughter, who is a Freshmen in High School....& she has not put it down since Christmas.....It's a great phone & great for HULU also!!!"
140,5,"It's the latest,and greatest from Apple. My wife loves it."
141,5,"Great camera, easy to use and I would recommend this to anyone who looking for a upgrade"
142,5,I love the IPhone X. Camera is incredible and a full screen with very small border is great. No more home button that’s replaced with a quick swipe & easy to get used to.
143,5,nice phone and very fast apps. the screen is way bigger than the 7 or 8 and super fast
144,5,Bought this phone for my wife or Christmas and she loves it. Super fast and screen is amazing. Face ID feature works flawlessly too.
145,5,Upgraded my IPhone from 5S to X. Could not be happier. The 10 is great!
146,4,"I have owned almost every generation of iPhone and this has the best battery and screen resolution by far. However, I miss the thumbprint security features compared to the Face ID. Face ID will not work unless you’re looking at the screen and this is a hassle if you want to glance at your screen without actually looking directly at it. It also will not work if my eyes are closed or my face is partially covered."
147,3,Not really sure why it cost so much more than the seven or eight camera quality seems to be the same as seven and eight a bit pricey
148,5,I loved my 6plus but the X is even better. Processing is quicker.
149,4,"I wouldn't say this phone is a game changer but it's okay. It has issues with face recognition and the pulling apps from the bottom up is a bit of a pain when it doesn't work. The clarity is nice and the camera is great but overall I would just say it's the latest apple phone and give it an ""Ok"""
150,5,This phone was easy to use and the camera is unmatched.
151,5,Size is just about perfect. Love the screen and Face ID
152,5,iPhone X is great. Very happy with it. I don't notice the notch as much as other reviews say because the screen is huge. I rarely use it in landscape mode as well. Happy camper.
153,5,Thanks honey I have to do a good job and working on my house today
154,5,"Face ID works great and you won’t miss the home button after a few new gestures become second nature. Apple finally made the phone a blonde one thicker to put a battery (actually 2 batteries) in that lasts all day! The X gives you the screen size of a Plus in a form factor that fits easily in your pocket. If you are going to spend the money on a flagship phone, this should be the one you buy."
155,5,"Great phone! Everything that advertisements had promised. Fast with a beautiful display, and a really high quality camera."
156,5,Bought it as a Christmas gift and the person loved it.
157,4,"I like the total size of this, always felt my plus was just too big so the X is great since it’s smaller but the screen is Larger than the plus. Having no home button took getting used to and sometimes it’s annoying the the face lock doesn’t work if your laying down. If the latest tech isn’t a big priority for you I would get this. The price of it is NOT justified by the new features, although the battery life of it is great, like really great. Lasts me till bed time and I take it off the charger around 6am every day"
158,5,Upgrade my iPhone 6 to the iPhoneX and its such a big difference!! Great pictures and very fast running.
159,5,"The iphone x is awesome. I really like the face recognition. In my opinion, it is better than the finger print and quicker, especially if you are holding other things."
160,5,"Yes, the price is high... but the phone performs beautifully and the screen is amazing!"
161,5,I thought I would struggle without the home button but I got use to it within 2 minutes. Love this phone.
162,5,"It’s difficult to put in words,The Intuitive Comfortability and Amazing Hands On Experience of the iPhone X - An Absolute Marvel....!"
163,5,Apple finally gave us something different and this phone is a beast.
164,5,I’ve had about every iPhone since the 3GS days and this is def the best one yet! It was def time for a refresh in design and this is the best device for one handed use with a 5.8 inch screen I’ve seen yet!
165,5,"Never had a Apple device, won’t ever go back to galaxy"
166,5,Camera is amazing but charging is slooooooooooooow.
167,5,My wife and I both upgraded our phones to the iPhone X. I switched back to iPhone from a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and am very happy. The screen is bigger than on my S7 edge but the phone is smaller. The lack of a home button is easy to get used to and the facial ID for security is great!
168,5,"This phone lives up to all I expected and more. I am still exploring what all it does, but at this point I am very pleased. It is quick, the screens are crisp & clear, the sounds very nice. A great jump up from my iPhone5."
169,4,"Very nice, new design, bigger screen and face recognition technology."
170,5,Upgraded from the 7 to the X and this is so a cool phone. Features are amazing.
171,5,So far so good. No problems as of yet. Everything works as it should
172,5,Upgraded to the X from a six. Have to get used to the new features and not having a home button. But works well. Camera is an upgrade.
173,4,Awesome screen.awesome camera.the best iPhone yet.
174,5,iPhoneX 256 gb is by far my favorite iPhone to date. It was easy to adjust to the new gestures right away and had no problem at all with transitioning away from the classic home button as many fear. I highly recommend iPhoneX 256 to anyone.
175,1,the battery life is very bad and regret buying it.
176,5,I love my new iphone x it is better than I could asked for.
177,5,Best Buy was great in getting the phone set up and explaining the basics on how it works! Love the phone. It didn't take long to get use to the new features! I actually find them to be very user friendly.
178,5,I love this pretty iPhone design but I wish Apple make screen a little bit bigger.
179,3,"It will be a good phone soon, but as off now ? Not so much"
180,4,"Drop calls, hard to learn! Do love the bigger screen though. I’d wait a few months"
181,4,"The phone is very polished, although many functions have changed. It does take some getting used to!"
182,3,"good phone. although i wish they didnt get rid of fingerprint scanner. also once the phone is unlocked it should take me straight to the home screen, instead i have to press the screen again."
183,5,great phone. face id is awesome and i do like not having the home button
184,5,"Love the speed and camera on this phone, a solid upgrade over previous model"
185,4,Got this phone for my daughter and she likes the size better then the 7 Plus that she had. This one is right in between the regular size and plus size. She also says the screen is really nice and seems better then her old phone. She still wishes she could charge the phone and plug in headphones at the same time though.
186,5,I have had the last 7 iPhones and this is the first time I was like wow what a difference. The screen is gorgeous and having no home button makes this I one handed phone. Love it
187,5,"This phone is just fabulous. I don't miss the home button at all. The facial recognition doesn't work as perfectly as I had hoped, but I am still giving it 5 stars. You just have to be sure the phone is held up and aimed right at your face. I feel it is highly over priced really, but then again, it is a great product. I wouldn't consider any other phone but an iPhone."
188,5,Great phone ever best result best speed and awsm look
189,5,I didn't know how fast and easy to use could be until I had used this phone for a couple of weeks. Really like it!
190,4,"I have been an iPhone user since the first iPhone. I purchased this phone about an month ago and am still getting used to some of the new ways it works. I am very happy with the camera. It does well in low light and the quality of the pictures in general is outstanding. Although the phone covers most of the screen, I still find it smaller than the 6s I upgraded from. Facial recognition is a feature I really like. Swiping is talking me a little bit of time to get used to and I like it although it seems cumbersome when you want to fully close out an app. The method requires swiping up and stopping in the middle of the screen, then holding until a red -- appears in the corner of the app. You then have to click on the red -- to close each particular app. Overall, I like the phone but mainly because of the camera quality."
191,5,Best phone I ever owned by far the camera is incredible and Face ID is just genius.
192,5,"Love the new iPhone, I love the sleek design and the ease of use."
193,5,"Absolutely love it. Takes amazing photos in portrait mode. Screen is the best one Apple has produced to date, you have to see it to really appreciate how good it is. Love the fact that the footprint of the phone is barely bigger than a 6/7/8 but screen is bigger than the 6/7/8 plus."
194,5,"Its a great phone, i thought the notch would bother me but since i don't watch videos on it its fine. Little on the expansive side but its worth it."
195,5,Nice phone--it's always nice to upgrade and get the improved camera and features.
196,5,I upgraded from the iPhone 6s Plus. So far the battery is fantastic the speed is second to none. I I was skeptical about the facial unlock verses the fingerprint but I have to say I prefer the facial unlock over the fingerprint. No need to worry about taking your gloves off in the winter to unlock your iPhone! It’s amazing and I would highly recommend it.
197,5,Best camera in the market by far thanks mike for you help
198,3,Our son really likes this phone larger screen. Takes great pics
199,4,Not too much different from the plus iPhone. Bigger screen
200,5,I like the iPhone X. I came from using an iPhone 6 16gb that was recently plagued by the apple update “slow down”. Nice phone operates well. Good camera.
201,5,"The Screen looks amazing, it’s much faster than my iPhone 7, great phone."
202,5,I love the new iPhone X. It has facial recognition and lots of other cool functions that are not available on the other iPhones. I have also discovered some apps that are specifically for the iPhone X. I have noticed the battery life is great.
203,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE my new phone. Upgraded from the iPhone 6 Plus 64gb to the iPhone X 256gb. Love the face ID. Took about 2 days to get fully used to not having a home button anymore.
204,5,Not a bad phone. New faceid needs to be improved. Display are good. My wife wanna a bigger screen.
205,5,"I was hesitant about spending the money for the X, but figured I use my phone more than any other device in life, so might as well splurge. This thing is fantastic. The facial recognition log in is excellent - I don't even think about the phone pulling up at all any more. It just opens. Battery life is excellent as well as speed. Good job Apple and good deal Best Buy."
206,5,It’s a awesome phone lot you can do with it fun time
207,5,But love the size of my phone so that’s a good thing.
208,5,I like the iPhone X. Not noticing significant difference between iPhone 7 vs X with speed however face rec. feature ruined saving!!
209,4,Very good iPhone so far! At first it was difficult to control but got hang of it within a month.
210,5,Took a while to get use to not using the Home button
211,5,Great phone. The camera takes excellent photos. The best iPhone yet.
212,5,Great screen size but the act phone is still a good size to hold in one hand. Takes a little getting used to the new no button format but no regrets yet.
213,5,I love the improvements apple made on this phone! Weird without the home button but only took 3 days to get used to. Loving my new phone
214,5,Wanted to upgrade from I -phone 6 I am beyond Happy with my New Iphone X
215,5,"Wasn't planned to get a new phone, but so glad I did! Missed the home button at first, but not anymore. Camera on the phone is great and I enjoy the larger screen."
216,5,Phone has a great camera. Love the portrait mode .
217,4,"Love my new phone - just getting use to it, but do love the size!"
218,5,screen and pictures are amazing. Face Id doesn't work when it is darker. Battery last significantly longer.
219,5,screen and pictures are amazing. Face Id doesn't work when it is darker.
220,4,"Since the 6/6plus, the iPhone really hasn’t had too much progress in the way of updates... until now. The X is the most innovation in the iPhone in 3 generations of models. If you have waited to upgrade, this is the one."
221,5,"My last iPhone was the 6, so I was ready to upgrade and I have to say I LOVE my iPhone X. There were a lot of questions about Face ID, but after using my phone since launch, I can verify that it does work as simply as demonstrated. The feature I love the most however is the battery life. I always felt the Plus iPhones were too large for my pockets and grip, but this one is just right - and b/c of the midway size increase, the battery life with average use lasts me up to 2 days between charges. That means the battery should last twice as long! FYI I replaced my iPhone 6 battery after about 2 years, so this is a great deal. Strongly recommended! Best iPhone yet!!! Plus the Animoji's are hilarious -- if you want a laugh check out #animojikaraoke on twitter ;)"
222,5,This phone is very nice and very fast. Love the face recognition feature. Definitely worth paying the extra money upgrade.
223,5,My second year of using a IPhone and I love it! The camera is amazing and I love how smaller it is compared to the 7 plus!
224,5,I’m still on the fence about the whole not having a home button and since I wear glasses I had to turn down the sensitivity of the face recognition so I wouldn’t have to take my glasses each time to unlock my phone. But other then that I absolutely love the sleekness of the phone and before I had the iPhone 6s Plus so I have to say it runs faster and I’ve had no issues with it to make me wish I would of bought the 8. After going to Apple I don’t think I could handle going back to any kind of android since my car links up to the iPhone with such ease. Super happy with my purchase.
225,5,"I have no complains about my new phone. Definitely, I can recommend it to buy."
226,3,"I regret switching my plus model for the x, not worth it."
227,4,"Great size, fast and simple to adjust and use. Lacks advanced settings and functions almost to simple for the price."
228,5,"The fact that it did not have a home button made me not want to buy it at first, but all the extra features are so worth it."
229,5,The size and value is a great sweet spot for plus users that were annoyed about carrying such a large phone.
230,5,"I replaced an iphone 6+ with a new iphone X this weekend and the experience was outstanding. Not only did they provide top dollar in bestbuy credit for the replacement phone but we got an excellent deal on a case. The bestbuy representative did everything required to setup and transfer all our apps, media, etc. It takes about an hour but we walked out with a new phone, case and some extra credit on a best buy rewards card. Shopping at Apple or a carrier is not as forgiving as shopping at BestBuy. Thank you and great job."
231,5,Definitely a good phone Apple has done a great job
232,5,"Went in to purchase the 8 Plus, but glad that I decided to get the X. The camera is amazing, love the face ID and other security features!"
233,5,Started getting really warm when using the Arlo app overnight but after the recent updates it was fixed.
234,5,"this case does not add up much bulk to the phone and it protect it all around, i have drop it several time and not a scratch to the phone yet"
235,5,best iphone so far... easy to use and only complaint is no bluetooth headphone included
236,5,"As a nurse, I’m constantly washing my hands... so fingerprint access wouldn’t work. Now I can log on in the dark at night, pruny wet fingers. Love the 256 gb, the full screen!"
237,5,"Had the iPhone 7 plus, which was great!! However the size of the 10 is much better for me. Screen is amazing and the overall performance is amazing. Very happy with this phone."
238,5,Works great I would recommend to some one else. Good help at dtore
239,5,I love how easy this phone is to use and gave recognition is awesome
240,5,Love the iPhone X. I’ve had the 6 for a long time I was ready for a change. The only trouble I noticed was when I try to open an app it take a few tries like as if my it’s not feeling my finger there. Other then that so far I like it.
241,5,No issues or complaints. woks well as with most i phones
242,5,My initial hesitation to wait was too cautious. This is a great phone. Facial recognition is fantastic.
243,5,"Got this for my wife, she loves it. The animojis are fun, and overall great fast phone."
244,3,I’ve had an iPhone since the 3G and even though this is the newest and greatest it’s not all that. I got it for my wife to replace her iPhone 6 and we almost returned it. Screen is nice and it’s fast but there is a lot she doesn’t like about it. I don’t even like to use it. We almost returned it for the 8plus but wound up keeping it. I’d wait for the next one with some modifications.
245,5,"Haven’t had phone long, but it works great so far. The camera is very nice."
246,5,Moved up from a 6S and find the X to be easy to hold and use.
247,5,The iPhone X is the most powerful beautiful phone they have ever created. Not having a home button is not even an issue since you get so use to how fast using the home bar is.
248,1,"I wanted an unblocked, without carrier... when got back to Brazil, found out that it is blocked. Don't recommend it to any foreigners."
249,5,I have had this phone for two months. I have not had any issues.
250,5,Had it for two months and have not had any issues.
251,5,I have to leave my phone in my vehicle when I'm at work and the cold used to kill the battery on my IPhone 6. The cold doesn't kill the battery on the IPhone X
252,5,"I like very much to buy at Best Buy, great products portfolio and good services offered, Laudalio."
253,5,Can’t say enough about how great the iPhone X is. I was skeptical about Face ID at first (which I feel most people are) but it works far better than I expected. I actually like it better than Touch ID. Awesome job apple!
254,1,It slowed down on day 3! The battery life is poor and getting worse. Phone hates the cold!
255,5,This was a great deal and Present for my wife...She loves it!
256,5,The size with a big screen did it for me. After using my 7plus for a year this one got me because of the size the speed was not bad too.
257,5,A great device it it has a lot of nee features that make this a great device
258,5,"I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it! As far as performance, I don't know. I don't use it."
259,5,"I purchased this for a gift for Christmas, and they loved it!"
260,5,Happy with my upgrade. Was looking for a new phone for awhile and the Iphonex was what I needed.
261,4,"I don't know why the number 9 was skipped, but this phone has a great size. Very sleek and fast. I've had issues with faceID to unlock the phone, sometimes the clock and widgets would disappear and you see nothing but your wallpaper. I don't know if it's the phone or the iOS itself. It operates really fast, though. I'll admit that I kinda miss the home button and powering off with just one button. Yes, that's right. You have to power it off with 2 buttons."
262,5,"Had 2 Samsung Note 3’s for the last 4 years, never had a problem with either one but decided it was time to upgrade. Chose 2 iPhone X’s 256GB. All we can say is WOW! Bye bye Samsung, hello iPhone. Like having a pocket size IPad Pro"
263,5,Great product. Much light and easier to use than previous models. Best iPhone upgrade by Apple so far
264,5,It is by far their best phone. I was concerned about face recognition but I actually love it. The new features take some getting used to but worth it. Oh and the cameras are amazing.
265,5,Phone is great. Take a minute to get used to no home button. Like the phone a lot.
266,5,Great addition to the Apple lineup. The smoothest UI I’ve ever used on a smartphone. Just hope they design an XL next year.
267,4,Upgrading from iPhone 4 to an X made the wait worth it but the cost is outrageous and the facial recognition doesn't always work in poor lighting or if you delay bring it up to face.
268,5,Love my new phone. New features take a bit to get used to but all in all Apple did a nice job on this new phone. Best Buy was awesome to work with in getting my full profile brought over from my old phone to the new one. Would definitely recommend purchasing your new phone from Best Buy.
269,5,So far so good! i'm sure it does so much more then i have begun to touch on but for the basics..talk...photo...fast searching and apps....i love it!
270,5,Face ID does not disappoint. It works every time. It is fast enough that you don't even know it happened. The bigger screen with the smaller form-factor makes this phone a winner!
271,5,"I really like this iPhone. The notch at the top does not bother me at all. Battery life is really good as I am on my phone constantly. The screen size is just perfect, and I like that the bezels are virtually non-existing. Great phone."
272,5,"I like that technology improves everyday more, the camera and thinsg you can do with phone are amazing"
273,5,"Easy to use, fast. Best iPhone and I’ve had them all."
274,4,"I think it's the best iPhone yet, but I give it 4 stars because it's so pricey."
275,5,Bought this for our son and he loved it. Camera is outstanding!
276,5,Definitely a worthwhile upgrade from the iPhone 7.
277,5,MOVED FROM THE NOTE HARD TO ADAPT BUT A GOOD PHONE OVERALL
278,5,So far it works like advertised and I have not had any problems. The battery seems to last much better than my 6s
279,5,"I was torn between the iPhone 8 Plus and the X. I had been really happy with my 6 Plus, but decided to upgrade so I could give my phone to my daughter as a starter phone being she was familiar with it. I am so happy I chose the X. The camera is amazing and I love that it fits in my hand. Plus, it is so fast when opening apps and emails."
280,5,This phone has been amazing. You quickly get used to not having a home button and don't miss it. The Face ID recognition is awesome. It works perfectly and I love how I just look at my phone and it automatically signs me into websites I visit often.
281,5,A good phone. Not sure if it's better than my old one but I'm giving it a shot. :)
282,5,"Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, I wasn't expecting to be blown away. Turns out, I was still wowed by this phone."
283,5,I am very please with overhaul purchase in store at Huntington Mall. I always am a satisfied customer. Thank you Best Buy
284,5,"My wife loves her new phone, she yet to find anything wrong with it."
285,3,"Expected more features for the price. Too expensive, camera is great, Face ID ok, expected larger screen"
286,5,Definitely love the iPhone X love how it’s all screen and no home button
287,4,I bought this as a gift. It is the newest iPhone with the latest features. So far she is happy with it.
288,5,Best iPhone yet. Once you get used to the swipe gestures this phone is simply the fastest phone I have ever used. Love that they didn't feel the need to put out another ginormous phone on the market. Was a relief to go back to a relatively small phone. The facial recognition has been flawless for me. I do notice some apps randomly lock up. More the developers fault I think. Love the phone.
289,4,Awesome phone and camera Face ID water resistant wireless charging
290,5,the camera is as good as advertised and the screen clarity is awesome. she loves the facial recognition feature to open the phone.
291,5,The updated iPhone has been everything I expected and more. The Face ID works perfectly and the camera is outstanding.
292,5,"I was hesitant at first cause I love(d) the home button.. but this iPhone X with the facial recognition is sweet. Bigger screen, yet still small enough to use one handed. Way to go Apple."
293,5,the staff at best buy was very helpful every step of the way
294,5,"Great pictures, great microphone, easy to use, Apple out did itself! Love it"
295,5,Best iPhone ever. I had an iPhone 4s years ago then all Samsung phones. Love this iPhone.
296,4,"So I said I would never pay a thousand dollars for a phone......Well, never say never. I read all there was to read about the iphone X and I knew going in it was very expensive. I had a 6 Plus and it was painfully slow (everyone now knows why) and I was just tired of messing with it. I was in Best Buy (where I get all my phones) and I decided to make the leap. Here are my initial thoughts. Picture is supurb. The phone feels a lot smaller than my 6 Plus even though I know the screen is about the same size, it just feels smaller. Which, I guess is a good thing but I liked the size of my 6 Plus. But I put this phone in a bigger case to make up for that feel I missed with the plus size phone. I know, I'm an ""older"" user so having the convenience of slipping this phone in my pocket is not something I need like most on-the-go younger folks do, I just want to be able to see things on the screen and not feel like I don't have a handle on the phone. So I guess for me, size does matter. The face recognition has worked basically flawlessly for me so far. Its a pretty cool concept that probably needs some tweeking because I do find myself having to do more to get into the phone than I did before. You have to raise the phone to your face so it can identify you then you have to swipe up from the bottom of the phone to get into it. I think if they had a setting that would allow you to open the phone by face ID and not have to swipe to get in, I'd like that a lot better. Having said that, I've never been one of those people that uses a security code to get into my phone and I always worried about losing my phone and someone being able to get right into it. I just hated having to punch in a code each time I wanted to use it. I gave the phone to my wife for her to look at and delighted in the fact that she was totally frustrated that she could not get into it. She kept pointing the phone at me to unlock it and I would look away and it would not unlock. I have to admit, I do like that security feature and not having to punch in a code to get into it is pretty cool to me. I know several others have complained about the fact that now you have to swipe down from the top to get the control center and you have to do a swiping gesture to open up the multiple window function. I guess for me, its no big deal to have to swipe now rather than hit a button. If you grew up using virtually every variation of iphones going back to 2007, you are used to the button. But this one does not have a button and everyone that buys it should know that so why on earth would not having a button be an issue? I don't know, its just different and a lot of people don't like change. Me, I have no problem. I have heard that Apple might be bringing a virtual button back in the next update but all the functionality of the phone works fine for me. Its blazing fast, and that is what I am most happy about. The camera, both video and pictures, works very well. I am a bit of a semi-professional photographer and I will never stop using my DSLR cameras but this phone takes pretty amazing pictures, I have to admit. In fact, I also do some video editing on my Mac and the video images rivaled my 4k Canon 6D. I was really impressed with the video. One more aspect that is greatly improved is the audio of this phone. And I don't necessarily mean quality audio, even though I do think its better, I mean the volume. I use my phone when I get ready in the morning to listen to the watch ESPN app and at times on my 6 plus, the audio was not loud enough to hear when I was running water or something like that. On this phone, I have zero issues hearing it. I'm very impressed with that aspect alone. Its amazing how much sound comes out of this phone. In conclusion, for me, someone who lives in a Mac ecosphere, (Mac computer, iPad's, Apple watch, multiple iPhones and Mac book pro), this device is very familiar. If you've used iPhones for a while in the past, you will have no trouble adapting to the changes that to me, are intuitive because there is no home button. I had no trouble figuring..."
297,5,"I see it... It’s sees me.... I recognize it... it recognizes me... Actually great device; great use of real estate... if you need a Plus, buy the Mini"
298,5,"An easy to use (once you get some exposure to the i-crowd). I wish it came with some instructions, but Google gets it done. A bit pricey."
299,5,I am way happier with the new iPhone! I had a iPhone 6S plus and as much as I loved the big screen it was just junk from start to finish but the new X runs and performs way better with no issues!
300,5,The iPhone X is an excellent upgrade from the my previous version of the 7. The camera take amazing photos. The feature are great. I do recommend.
301,5,Great improvement over the previous iPhone...worth the money
302,5,The camera is outstanding! The speed of the devise is unbelievable. I am so pleased.
303,5,its a good phone jsut dont know if is worth that much money but when your wife ask for it what can you do lol
304,5,Enjoying my Iphone X and the new features. I love the quality of the product. Best phone I have owned.
305,5,Love the face ID and how fast the phone responds. The screen is just as big as the plus and the phone is easier to hold. The camera is phenomenal.....so happy that I upgraded
306,3,Screen saver for some reason unlocks horizontal when I closed phone vertical...hmm Wish I could swap out this phone for another.
307,5,Face ID works great and the screen looks amazing..
308,4,At first the iPhone X was very confusing but once you get to use it you will get used to it just like anything else very quickly
309,5,"It’s the best iPhone yet, the Oled screen is amazing as is the cameras"
310,5,"Easy to use, particularly for someone already familiar with the iPhone."
311,5,Love the features and speed of this device. Great job Apple
312,5,"Love the upgrade, but not the price tag. That's what you get for having the coolest phone available."
313,5,Love the new full OLED screen. Colors are so vibrant!
314,5,Got item for my kids for Christmas. They absolutely love phone.
315,5,Works well with Otter Box so far. Would like to see privacy screens for sale
316,4,The associate and mobile manager were very helpful.
317,5,Overall like the new phone but just takes a little adjustment learning the new lack of a button.
318,5,Early Xmas gift for my 17 yr old. He loves it. Prticey at $1000 but definitely an eye-catcher.
319,5,"Best camera on a phone. Ever. Caution on the screen, it is the same OLED as the Samsung Galaxy and I would HIGHLY recommend getting the Apple care. It’s $7 a month, and I promise it would be over $300 to get that screen fixed, and that’s if you could find someone who knew what they were do it. Just a thought."
320,5,Excellent phone. long battery life. Smaller phone same screen size
321,5,Didn’t plan on this purchase but stopped to look at new phones. With all the features and the ability to upgrade I bought it and am very happy.
322,5,"I have had my iPhone X for a month now and I love it. For someone who loves Touch ID, the Face ID took some getting used to. Other than that, hopefully this is the direction Apple is going in."
323,5,Very good phone and easy to use. My kids love it .
324,5,Apple really has outdone itself with this phone. It has so many different useful features that Im still learning on how to use them all.
325,5,"Love this phone easy to use, fun to use. The full home screen is the best part of the phone."
326,5,Definitely worth the wait! Still discovering all it has to offer.
327,4,"The new iPhone is great. Portrait mode for the camera is awesome. However, the GPS does not pick up my exact location which is frustrating when I use it to drive"
328,5,Love the iPhone X. So much fun to use. Not having a home button is great!
329,5,What’s not to love!?! Totally enjoying my new iPhone.
330,5,Fast clean clear love this phone. Worth the price.
331,5,This phone is awesome the price is a little high but well worth it!
332,5,Absolutely best phone I’ve ever owned !!! And I have owned a lot of them...
333,5,Great phone super fast love the screen and love the compact phone with the large display
334,5,iphone X features an all-screen design with a 5.8-inch Super Retina HD display with HDR and True Tone. Designed with the most durable glass ever in a smartphone and a surgical grade stainless steel
335,4,Amazing portrait filter for both cameras! Facial recognition is absolutely amazing! The only downside is the size of the phone itself!
336,5,"Great for me but it’s smaller than the plus that I had. Disappointed in the screen size though, even though it’s bigger when videos play they are the same size as my previous 6 plus"
337,3,"At first I was a little hesitant to buy this phone because it was it was so expensive but with the investment I had already made with apple I figured I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. While it is true that many of the touted features (face rec, wireless charge, etc) are a nice to have, they have been around for some time now. I, like thousands of others, are disappointed in the lack of a headphone jack but am making due with some bose earbuds I bought with it. At any rate, my initial feedback is good but I do not see the cutting edge technology that Apple is known showing up in this phone. Dont get me wrong, it is a great phone but so are the other phones in this ""class"" of premium phones."
338,5,I’ve only had this iPhone X for three days but it was easy to get used to. I have noticed that the battery last longer than my previous iPhone 6.
339,5,"Originally had no desire to upgrade to the iPhone X, but it’s by far the best iPhone released to date."
340,4,Been excited about this iPhone I upgraded from a 6plus so I definitely was do for an upgrade. I wanted a whole different iPhone than all the previous ones they all pretty much look the same to me. So like I said I went from a plus to this n I must say even though the screen is bigger on this new iPhone I liked the screen on the plus it’s wider n when texting the keyboard ain’t as crammed. Another thing is the whole swipe is totally different then regular iPhones. I hate the whole closing of apps seemed easier to do on other iPhones. Plus had to YouTube how to screen shot since there’s no button. It’s a whole learning experience. I miss my plus
341,5,"the iphone x is amazing. it has great camera loud and clear speakers and best of all, long battery life..."
342,5,"Nice camera, bigger screen and easier to carry, Love the face recognition"
343,5,"Best iPhone yet they really got everything right. Steep price but, worth it in the end."
344,5,"Love the new iPhone. Easy to use, intuitive ... such a joy to use."
345,5,"Not sure what I can say about it. If you’ve always had an iPhone this is a major improvement. If you coming from android, welcome and enjoy. The simplicity of the iPhone makes your life easier."
346,5,The camera has so may options the pictures are much better than the IPhone 7
347,5,"It’s not perfect but then again, it comes pretty close to it. Closer then anyone else. Love it. Not really happy about the battery percentage not being displayed but I’ve learned to live with it. Small learning curve with the new gestures but very easy to get used to and within the first few hours you’ll feel at home with it. Recommend."
348,5,This is a great iPhone to have. It might take a little getting used to with the new swiping gestures but very easy to learn!
349,5,There is a bit of a learning curve at first with the lack of a home button but overall apple delivers! The facial recognition is super convenient and the gestures make you feel like you are more in control. The pictures it takes are beautiful. Hands down the best iPhone yet!
350,5,Love this phone face recognition is pretty cool just have to get use to the size
351,5,This was a gift for my daughter She really likes it The Samsung app doesn’t let her watch work as well as her Samsung phone
352,5,This phone is amazing. It literally is a small computer. The possibilities are endless.
353,5,"Great item! High quality, looks great. Easy process. Love my new phone!"
354,5,"Upgraded from 6plus to iPhone 10. Pretty much same interface, just with a new face lift. Love the new design. Only took a few hours to get use to gesture."
355,5,This phone is awesome. There is a small learning curve with the home button being removed.
356,5,Great camera and I love Face ID which is more secure than Touch ID
357,5,There's a bit of learning this phone since I was use to Samsung. I like it a lot and it's getting easier. Perfect size phone. No problems so far.
358,5,I am so happy that I got this phone. It is even better than I expected.
359,5,I love my new iPhone X. It is smaller in my hand than the 7 Plus I had prior but I quickly adapted and wouldn’t go back. Must have!
360,5,"Smooth, fast, many amazing features. A quality product. Hey, it's an Apple."
361,5,Love this phone Doesn’t come with instructions but I YouTubed it and I am so in love with my phone
362,5,This phone is super fast and responsive. The size is perfect for your hands.
363,5,Whatever you need or any problems you may encounter with an iphone... Best Buy is the place to purchase it. No hassle for help like AT&T or Apple.
364,4,"Same as any other iPhone. Works fine now, just hope that it will continue to work as time goes on."
365,5,"I was nervous to switch from my 7 plus, but man I am glad I did. It is a fantastic phone, and the screen is remarkable. Highly recommend"
366,5,It’s a great phone and easy to use and I like the size too.
367,5,great phone in screen and lot of storage. battery seems to last a long time as well
368,5,"iPhone X is well worth the money. From the QI charging to the face recognition, you will not be disappointed. I purchased the 256 gig memory due to the HD recording, combined with Apple Care Plus put this purchase over $1300. On a positive note we received a iPhone 8 as a BOGO promotion. Nice job Best Buy and AT&T"
369,4,Purchased at Newington Best Buy. The customer service was great. The camera is sweet. Phone has a lot of good features. Pricy though.
370,5,I’ve always had android phones. After seeing one of these in person I couldn’t resist. Absolutely love it. Camera is amazing.
371,5,The phone is good. Only problem I have with the phone is that it’s small thought they would have a plus size for it but other then that it’s good.
372,5,the best iphone ever made. a great phone at an extreme value.
373,4,Bought at Amazon store with great help from salesman. Got unlocked to use with my company account - simple activation. Phone itself is awesome with Face ID and an incredible screen. Decent battery life thus far :)
374,5,Love the large screen in the same size phone. Best iPhone yet
375,5,"I’m a huge iPhone fan, and love the new features of this phone, especially wireless charging and FaceID"
376,5,I really like the new features on this phone. Camera quality is great
377,4,Great phone with a lot of extras. It's awfully pricey. I am concerned that maybe Apple dialed back the speed on the old phone I had in order to sell the newer products. Great customer service from Best Buy
378,5,The phone is great with many excellent features. It was easy to set up and transfer data/photos from my older iPhone 6. Only tricky thing was understanding how to transfer my existing service but a quick web search got that taken care of.
379,5,I absolutely love this phone. The cameras are awesome!!
380,5,I absolutely love this phone! I’ve had it just over a week and I was used to everything new within a day except the feature where you have to hold an app before swiping up to hard close them. My new favorite feature besides Face ID is the portrait mode in the camera and the upgraded cameras!
381,5,Wow!!Great phone and I’m still learning new features!! Wow!! Expensive!! Not sur yet if it’s worth the extra cash but I am enjoying it if I can just remember that there is no home button!
382,5,I love my new cell phone. It took time to learn all the new features. But with the help of Google and the awesome Best Buy employees I have learned how to use my new phone.
383,5,I love this phone. It has an amazing camera and the screen resolution is amazing. Took a minute to get used to no Home button but now would not go back to a button
384,5,The best iPhone ever made. The best camera on a phone and at a tremendous value.
385,5,I’m a apple product person and I enjoy my upgrade. Now I’m talking with Family and Friends about the latest apple products
386,5,Went from 6+ to x. Love love love. Only took a few minutes to transition with the changes. The new size is great. Basically same screen size as the 6+ but easier to hold.
387,5,At first its hard cause were all used to the button in the bottom but in 1 day of usage you get used to it. Overall phone great
388,5,"I have been using my iPhone X for about 4 weeks. It is the best and fastest iPhone on the market. I am amazed by its screen - no other iPhones can beat it. It is so fast. No delays to open apps on it. I love it, although I have to admit it is quite expensive."
389,5,This is my second iPhone ever.! And I must say this iPhone X has really stood up to its hype. The battery life is amazing and the extra screen size is really nice. You get used to the small center screen cutout.
390,5,"a nice upgrade from the iPhone 6s Plus, couldnt be happier."
391,5,my son had to have it for xmas and its a good phone but didnt live up to the hype for this exclusivity that they were trying to sell
392,5,"I purchased the iPhone X last month and I'm not disappointed with any of the changes or upgrades from my iPhone 6. Th picture quality is much better, it's much faster and with Face ID you access it instantly."
393,4,The size is great bigger screen than 7plus but overall smaller phone. Difficult to get used to no home button.
394,5,I love this phone. It is super smooth and not having the home button has already been forgotten. I love the big screen.
395,5,This phone was a Christmas present for my teenage son which is an upgrade from iPhone 6s plus. He loves it. Great sounds and excellent picture quality.
396,5,"I love my new phone. The phone has streamlined features and new features that make it easier to use. The picture quality is excellent. You still get the big screen without all of the extra phone size so the phone is much easier to handle, even with a case."
397,5,This is my first new phone since the iPhone 6. It’s also the first new phone since the 6 that I thought had enough new features to warrant a new phone. Face ID is awesome.
398,4,Another great iPhone from Apple. This time however there are some flaws that I’ve found. Face ID. Takes time getting used to. And not always consistent as Touch ID. iOS 11. Everything done on this phone is gesture based. No home button. This really takes some time to get used to. Also iOS 11 is plagued by bugs that really deter the experience. That’s why I left 4 stars honeslty. iOS 11 is a clunky mess that needs lots of work and can hinder the experience of this great phone.
399,4,"I really like the facial recognition and the camera. I don’t like how Apple restricts access to files with the new OS. For example, I used to be able to find images I took by connecting to a computer but that option is now gone."
400,5,I love my iPhone X! I was a little hesitant at first with it not having a home button. But after 5 min I did not miss it at all. Face ID works great and it is super fast! I love it!
401,5,"Costly but seems be worth it. Curved screen, bust costly for repair"
402,5,"Ive had every iphone that has came out after the 3G , and i mist say “ that i really do love this phone “ ! Especially the face recognition! I no longer have to use my fat large thumb multiple times to get into my phone . Just a simple tap to turn on ,or the phone itself knwoing you picked it up and looking at it . So that it unlocks! I love it !"
403,4,"Great phone, way too expensive, money no problem though...."
404,4,"Aside from all the fancy new features and bezeless display, it is an iPhone with IOS11. You can probably get the same features in the iPhome 8 and save a few bucks. The X is a lot smaller than I thought it would be so keep that in mind if you are coming from a larger phone."
405,5,Just have to get used to no home button but the clarity is amazing vibrant colors really fast processor
406,3,"Im honestly not very impressed with this phone. I was under the impression Apple was designing this phone with the ability to essentially be used as a computer, with connectivity to a keyboard and display. This is not a feature I would use often or is of great importance, but it is innovation and could help support the price of this. Additionally, why make this in all glass? (Aside from the fact that it will boost accessory sales as well as repair revenue). This phone still acts glitchy and I got the unlocked version with 256GB memorory. The unlocked version has 4GB of RAM vs the traditional iPhone X models (Carrier Specifict Models). You can research this to confirm if you doubt this is correct. I am at the point where I might just return the phone and either choose another alternative such as the Google2 phone or the BlackBerry KeyOne. My life is cluttered enough, sometimes getting back to basics is most important. Especially when the difference in price is $700.00!"
407,5,I love this phone! The camera takes such great pictures. The video quality is great as well. Best iPhone to date!
408,5,No home button = no problem! Emojis are fun. The processor is amazing! Best iPhone Apple has ever made!
409,5,"Great phone, fast and has a lot of cool options. The face recognition program is fun."
410,5,I’ve owned every iteration of iPhone. I can easily say that without a doubt this is the phone we’ve been waiting for. From the full screen to the animoji’s and 4K Video. This is the one.
411,4,Bought a 8 Plus and a X. The 8 Plus was the first product I ever recommended not to buy based on the price versus improvements. The X has more improvements but has even a higher price. I actually like the simple improvements and was easy to figure it out. ( I’m old and not tech savvy) If you have the money it’s nice
412,5,"The next generation phone, best choice for younger"
413,5,Apple did it again. This phone has awesome battery life and the screen wows
414,5,I love this phone so far. It’s smart!!! Both cameras are magnificent and the battery life is a lot better than previous phones. Display is exceptional also.
415,5,Its a gift for my sister and she should be the one to review :p
416,5,The camera is phenomenal. I am ecstatic about all of its capabilities.
417,4,I absolutely loved this phone at first. I have been in the Apple store twice and on the phone 2 times. After I had to wipe everything off my phone and started over I am trying to fall in love again.
418,5,best purchase for the year. animated emoji best part of this version.
419,5,Great great great great great great great great great
420,3,"Upgraded from a 5s, huge upgrade. Too many bugs, Pandora makes it soft restar CONSTANTLY, the lock screen tends to disappear CONSTANTLY... things you wouldn’t expect from a $1,200+ phone."
421,4,Everything as advertised. Great phone and pics. Still exploring the fun things to do. Only wish that Best Buy would have included activation instructions for my upgraded phone. I was able to figure it out on my own but it just would have made things a little simpler
422,5,I love the phone. Apple has make another fine product.
423,5,It takes a awhile to get used to no buttons. It has a awesome screen
424,5,Love camera. Love swiping love not having home button.
425,5,The anniversary iPhone X is the best of breed. It has truly awesome specs. The price is equal to the quality and performance - high. but work every penny
426,5,I love this iPhone and like the Face ID feature. Also the pictures clarity is phenomenal. The volume of the ring sound lowers as soon as you look at it and it recognizes your face which is great too.
427,4,"In fact I thought I would have a way better camera, but is not a big deal. I may go visit a technician t see if my is working well"
428,5,Love my new phone it’s amazing Best Buy is awesome would recommend to anybody sales people very friendly I will always return
429,4,"I was super content with my old 5s and had no intention of upgrading, but very Glad I did. The picture quality is amazing!! Same similar functions as the old phone so it’s very easy to use, if you are familiar with the iPhone."
430,5,"I wasn't sure I wanted this new phone until I was having trouble with my 7,but the retina scanning is the most amazing this I have seen in a while. It really works well and is so hassle free when it comes to using the phone. This is jus one of the many features I love, the other is the sharpness of the new camera. Well done Apple!"
431,5,Nice phone. Takes some getting used to no home button. New learning curve.
432,5,I thought not having the home button would be a problem but swiping was easy to adapt to. Face recognition works well.
433,5,Great phone so far. Fairly reliable Face ID that works with most apps.
434,5,"I really love my phone and trully love the bestbuy.,"
435,5,Love face recognition and camera. No home button was a bit of an adjustment.
436,5,This iPhone is amazing..the full screen is awesome and the colors are vibrant! There is not a single thing on this phone I do not like! Highly recommend it!
437,5,"I really love this iPhone!! It took a little getting used to and how to work things. But once you do, it’s great!!"
438,5,The sliding up takes some getting use to without having the home button but I think it’s been a great upgrade!
439,5,Love the phone but the only real benefit of the iPhone X over the 8 is the OLED screen. Face recognition is nice but isn’t worth buying alone. Most apps don’t take advantage of the larger screen yet and crop it to the same size as if you had an 8
440,5,"Great phone, just wish they sokly have made a plus also"
441,5,The iPhone X is worth it. Both my brothers have it. I did a lot of research to find out if it was worth the extra money. I upgraded from the iPhone 6s. In the back of my mind I was thinking about trying it out for a day or two then taking it back. I will not be taking it back this phone is awesome.
442,4,"Love the IPhone X. Upgraded from an IPhone 6 Plus. I was worried about the home key going away, but it is no problem. The phone is very easy to use. Just hate the price tag, more than my first car!"
443,5,Love the feel. New size and screen a plus. No button getting comfortable.
444,5,My phone is terrific. I love that has all features
445,5,Wished it had a home button and it keeps freezing up a lot
446,4,"I bought as a gift, you need to learn a lot for the new operation"
447,5,This phone is amazing and very happy with my purchase.
448,5,The Face ID is worth the upgrade on its own. Plus having a smaller phone than the plus with an even slighter larger screen is no brainer to me. Have not found anything to complain about yet with the phone. Battery life is great as well.
449,5,"I upgraded from the 7 plus to the X and was initially concerned about the difference in size. Much to my surprise, the sleekness of this phone is very nice. I don’t even miss the larger size."
450,5,I love this iPhone!! Apple finally got rid of the screen border. Only negative is wish it came with AirPods:( Oh Well!! My husband loves his new IPhone X too!!
451,5,"Everything processes so much quicker than previous phones. Also, the facial recognition is fun and again speeds up the unlocking of the phone."
452,4,I think it is too early to buy this phone...especially as the price is so high. Not particularly impressed off the bat. I was expecting much better speed but have been disappointed so far. Facial recognition is not worth the hype...at least from my limited use.
453,5,"I love the larger screen size on this phone, camera quality is amazing, and the facial recognition is convenient. There are so many features that are new compared to my older version. I do think the price is high."
454,2,If you love your iPhone you’ll hate this phone. The size is great but the phone is terrible
455,5,"Easy to use, love the new update and the camera! The portrait camera feature quality is like taking pictures from a high end expensive camera!"
456,5,Worth the investment. It’s face recognition is exceptional
457,5,"Daughter loves IPhone. So we waited for Christmas. She works hard and needs,a phone she can rely on for safety reasons. It's something apple create is a classic reliable phone. Thank you."
458,5,iPhones get better and better. Now I want an iPhone X plus (when it comes out)
459,5,So far this is one of the best iPhone Apple has came out with! It’s a little different without the home button but learning about the new features is even better!
460,5,I love my iPhone X. The home button not being there was different but not bad.
461,5,"So far so good! Easy to go from 6S to the X. Fast, clear and bright screen. Much better photos!"
462,5,Glad I upgraded. Would have gotten 3 if they weren’t so expensive
463,5,"This smartphone is the best phone I’ve ever used - the speed, camera and capacity is robust."
464,5,Never knew getting rid of the home button would change my life.
465,5,Great phone best one I had yet upgraded from a iPhone 6
466,5,From the moment i bought it i loved it. I thought the phone being smaller was going to be a problem but the total opposite.
467,5,Best iPhone ever. Takes some getting used to as there is no home button. So much easier without one.
468,5,Upgraded from the iPhone 6 and I absolutely love it.
469,5,The phone is awesome it gives you the capability of performing numerous task seemlessly.
470,5,"Great screen and perfect size. Not as bulky as a plus. Camera is great, as good as my dslr."
471,5,"Just got my iPhone X and I can not believe how nice it is. I thought it would be hard to get used to not having a home button, it is not! And face recognition it works and it’s great! Best iPhone yet!"
472,5,I was not a fan of it at first but the camera is definitely so much better glad I bought it
473,5,This iPhone has the best camera. I am so happy with my purchase.
474,4,Bought the iPhone X for the camera since it's rated #2 by DXO Mark. I was hella disappointed when there's barely light in the room and the flash kicks in. It ruins the pictures with red eyes. That for me was enough not to keep it. Very disappointed
475,5,"This phone is absolutely amazing with an amazing camera. The detail is perfect. I upgraded my phone in time for a trip to Iceland and was beyond impressed by the pictures. The phone is very user friendly as usual and the extras like facial recognition are a nice added feature. The “notch” took some getting used to, but I don’t even notice it anymore. I do wish I could put the battery percentage on the battery again, but it’s not a huge deal."
476,5,"I love my iPhone X, works great I have it for a month now."
477,4,I am really impressed with my new IPhone X. It is definitely an upgrade from my IPhone 6 Plus
478,3,Good product but after using it for a week I returned it due to the lack of a home button and the multi-step process to close apps. Probably needs some tweaks to the software before I would reconsider. Much happier with my IPhone 8+.
479,5,I bought the iPhone X about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Face ID is amazing and I love how easy Apple pay is to use
480,5,Great phone. Good improvement over the iphone 7. Screen is amaizing.
481,5,Facial recognition works fine - not worried about storage ( 256 g) Glass protector and otter box - All doing just what they advertised !!!
482,5,IPhone X so much better than the IPhone 5. Facial Recognition is so cool and the new screen size from edge to edge is perfect. Larger screen and yet it still fits in my pocket. I bought it in the Capitola Mall Best Buy Store with help from Vanessa T. She was the best!!! I hated going to the AT&T store but Best Buy was great!
483,4,"I must admit, I am that guy that gets each new iPhone. They string me in every time! So being someone that has been through every version, I can honestly say this is my favorite iteration of the phone, ever. This is by far, the best iPhone! It’s fast, the screen is beautiful, and the facial recognition works amazingly. Many complain about that small bump that takes up real estate from the screen. It did bother me at first. After 2 weeks, I don’t seem to notice it anymore. My only complaint is the fingerprint reader unlocked everything faster. I didn’t even need to lift the phone. The facial recognition does work great, but you have to have your face right in front of it. I cant really consider that a flaw, seeing as that is what the phone intends to do. Overall, the phone is worth the money!"
484,5,Way more crisp and clear than last. Facial recognition is amazing and better than expected.
485,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 7 and I love it this phone is amazing
486,4,Got this for my wife and she adores it.. water proof stylish and amazing camera.. it's apple so storage sucks
487,5,Love the phones capabilities and the camera... must have
488,5,Best iPhone made by apple till date. Face ID works better than most people expected.
489,5,"I was skeptical about the lack of Home button and while it took me some time to get used to it, it is very easy to use. It makes the phone extremely seamless. At first, I thought Face ID wasn’t very accurate. It would not recognize me if my hair was pulled back or if i had glasses on. It learns your face. The more you use it, the more accurate it becomes. It even recognizes me in the dark. The camera is out of this world. Absolutely love it."
490,5,This is my first iPhone and I’m in love!!! Love the FaceTime app too
491,5,Switched from android and will never go back! Camera is awesome and love the face recognition!
492,5,"Best iPhone ever. Super fast, fantastic camera and elegant."
493,5,"Once you get use to the edge to edge screen you simply won’t be able to go back to the boxy old screens with big black block frames, no wasted screen space!"
494,4,"I have had my first iPhone for 2 weeks, the X. I love the processing speed and have been getting used to the operating procedures. The only mysterious/troublesome item so far is the sudden, unexplained loss of callers voices during a phone call. I've tried to find a ""mute"" button or switch, in case I accidentally pushed one, but have not been successful. ? ? ? Until I find the solution, I can't fully recommend the phone yet."
495,4,I really like the camera and sound system for the iPhone X. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my sister who is NOT a twin could unlock my phone using the face scanner!!
496,5,Very worth while for the price you put in for the phone
497,5,"I had ZERO desire to get he iPhone X, but when I went in to trade-in my iPhone 7 I fell in love with it. The colors are vibrant and the new gestures are easy to get used to."
498,5,Best ever!!! Love this so much and it’s easy to get used to
499,5,"Great phone. Facial recognition works well, no problems. I recommend upgrading."
500,5,I love the fact that this phone has the display size of the plus models but is just slightly bigger than the 9+ Morales. Love the gesture features in the facial ID
501,5,Very pretty IPhone X is the best phone around the world
502,5,"There are many choices, but Shanel was a great help to me in making the right choice for me. I am enjoying exploring all the great features of my new phone!"
503,5,So sleek and fast. Definitely happy with my purchase. The Face ID is my favorite feature and the photos are great quality.
504,5,Easy to get used to swiping without home button. Much faster than 6 plus I had.
505,5,"6.3 inch screen in the future will be amazing, but this new iPhone X is great , Face ID is better than Touch ID. The OLED panel can stay toe to toe with the Note 8. Only down side is the screen aspect ratio, once all apps are optimized with The iPhone X watching vids will be one of the best!"
506,5,This is a great phone. The camera blows all other iPhones away.
507,5,"Loving the phone so far. Held up a picture I took and sent to my gf, held her 7 next to the X and the difference in clarity was inszne."
508,5,"The design and build of the iPhone X is by far, the best of 2017. iOS 11 run fantasticly. Hard to justify the price though. I bought it outright and it maybe not be worth it. Anyone getting it on contract this is a smart buy"
509,4,"I love the idea of not having a home button. It is fast and efficient. At times it does not recognize my face, which can be annoying but other than that it’s great."
510,5,This is the best IPhone ever. It’s so easy to use and the safety of the Face ID is phenomenal.
511,5,This is the best phone hands down can’t beat it perfect phone
512,5,Phone is great. The screensize is life changing and the lack of home button hasn’t been an issue for day to day use
513,3,"No home button sucks! Buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which is more powerful."
514,5,Camera exceeds expectations with megapixels and mores.
515,5,It is the best iPhone that I have. Take nice pictures and I love the size.
516,4,"Great: Screen, haptic feedback, build, design Notch isnt a distraction Not so great: The notification centre, takes face id time to get better"
517,4,"Just bought this phone for my wife, she's always had apple. You know what to expect with IPhone, her o my complaint is minor, you can't view the battery percentage anymore you have to go to settings to see that. The camera is great."
518,4,Had the phone for about 2 wks and so far so good. Love the new interactions and the camera is awesome.
519,5,Best iphone by a great company Best Buy thanks for having it in stock
520,5,Really like the smooth lines and no home button...
521,4,Awesome ph with a very nice screen to body ratio. Feels gr8 in hand though not one hand manageable. I felt this is very fragile and need a bulky case in order to protect the piece which will take away the beauty of the ph which we are paid for. Should have touch is in my view.
522,5,There was great improvement in the new update for the Iphone. The facial recognition is great and works in near dark situations. The size is just right as its not too big as the Plus models have been recently. I would recommend this for someone looking for the most up to date technology.
523,5,Apple always does a great job. Works great and the new features are outstanding
524,5,Bought this iPhone for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Best iPhone on the market right now.
525,5,"Best iPhone I’ve ever had, hands down. I wouldn’t have any other iPhone."
526,5,"I love my new iPhone X! It takes great pictures, it is very fast the battery life is a lot better than any previous iPhones I’ve owned(from 4s till now)"
527,5,"Love this phone, I have no negatives, using the Face ID is like butter, so smooth!"
528,5,iPhone X has everything you need plus a whole lot more!
529,5,Love it smaller but large who knew. Very clean and fast
530,4,Liking this phone a lot so far!!! Best Buy was amazing and had it for us right away!!!
531,5,iphone is the best I've had since the first one. Customer service was great too
532,5,Love my new iPhone! Battery is great new features are awesome!
533,5,Great phone. Does everything I wanted it to do anymore and I love the memory space I have it
534,5,"If you’re considering buying, just do it! You won’t be disappointed!"
535,5,I bought this for myself and I love it and the improvemed camera so I bought another one as an Xmas gift for my wife
536,5,Have been an Apple product fan for a long time. The newest iteration of the iPhone certainly doesn’t disappoint!!
537,5,Smaller than my 7+ but the screen size is perfect. Easy to hold and operate. Sales rep who helped was awesome and patient
538,5,I love my iPhone X. It’s amazing! Highly recommend it
539,5,Just wonder! I’ve been using this phone for almost two months now and this thing phenomenal. The screen is beautiful! Battery life has been improved considerably. I had the iPhone 6s and upgraded to the iPhone 6s Plus because the battery was terrible on the smaller version of the phone so I was a bit skeptical of what the battery life would be like on a phone that is almost the same size as the 4.7 inch iPhone 6s. To my delight it lasts longer than my plus model!
540,5,I really like the Animoji and AR capabilities. Face recognition is a nice touch to the iPhone lineup.
541,5,Awesome Phone. Another great product put out by Apple.
542,5,Very good. Preactically. Awesome. Fun and great fittures
543,5,Upgrading from an 6s and wow this is fast. It takes awhile to learn the new gestures without a home button but other then that I can’t complain.
544,5,Absolutely love that the screen is still as large or slightly larger than my plus but the overall phone is smaller! Very sleek design. Excellent camera!!
545,5,By far the best iPhone so far. Do not miss the home button.
546,5,I spent a lot of time on YouTube trying to figure out whether to do an iPhone 8+ or the iPhone X Find me they seemed very close and I had enough of a gift certificate to close the price gap and boy am I glad. Find me they seemed very close and I had enough of a gift certificate to close the price And boy am I glad. As usual the staff at Best Buy for knowledgeable friendly and took the time with me as I was still on the fence when I walked in. Best Buy no place like it. iPhone X what can I say!
547,5,Great phone. Worth the upgrade from my iPhone 7. !
548,5,"Super sleek, easy to use, only thing that I feel could use more work is on the facial recognition software."
549,5,This phone is just...wow! The new features are amazing and though not necessarily worth the price tag still make me happy every time I use it!
550,5,"This is the best iteration of the iphone since it’s inception. It’s a nod to the original but includes all of the next gen tech such as wireless charging, edge-to-edge display, and an OLED display. Would definitely recommend this device."
551,5,"Although if it’s pretty exprensive, I think it’s worth the price. Upgraded from iphone 6s plus"
552,5,"Phone is fast, pictures are extremely clear and detailed. Features are perfect"
553,5,Lifelong iPhone user. It has been an easy transition to the new iPhone X. Have used it for several weeks and have enjoyed it immensely.
554,5,This phone is a nice upgrade from the 7 series phones. From the upgraded camera to facial recognition this phone has got it all.
555,5,"Great phone, lives up to all of the excitement built around it!"
556,5,"Super fast, great screen and love the FaceID. The lack of a home button is not an issue like I thought it may be."
557,4,"Overall enjoy the phone, Face ID works about 75% of the time so there’s not much to complain about"
558,5,I like the new iphone X. It looks very stylish and very nice upgrades
559,5,"Overall the performance, quality and design are simply spectacular. My personal favorite thing about the X is that you get a big screen without having to carry around a brick such as the Plus models."
560,5,"This phone is definitely the best iPhone yet. The Face ID is super easy and fast. The cameras are amazingly crisp and awesome portrait modes. The battery life is good and the wireless charging is a snap. Yes, Android folks are going to say we had a lot of it first, but I find iPhones are a lot simpler and user friendly when you’re not a computer genius that likes to jailbreak everything. Also, they don’t get all the viruses that androids do because they don’t let all the infected apps through. Well that’s my two cents at least. Take it for what it’s worth. I’m enjoying it very much."
561,5,Perfect phone everything you expect from Apple go and buy
562,5,I received my phone quicker than originally planned
563,5,Very good product. Pricey but better than my note 8 that I had.
564,5,This iPhone is definitely my favorite. The pics & camera are Awesome! Best IPhone yet!
565,5,I am so excited to have this phone. It was an excellent choice and the perfect upgrade.
566,5,I couldn’t believe the difference in the video and picture resolution compared to my iPhone 7 Plus. I’m still learning all of this phones capabilities.
567,5,I love the iPhone X. At first I had to remember all of my passwords for my apps on my old phone - but after that I was really impressed. The camera is amazing and the phone very responsive. No more double clicking the button on the front!!! - NO BUTTON!! Believe me - you'll get used to it quickly.
568,5,"The iPhone X is a mastery of design with its edge-to-edge screen, size, and screen clarity & brightness. Face ID is great and the Home button is not at all missed once you figure out the gestures. Battery life is great probably due to its OLED screen. Animotions are fun as well. Overall the iPhone X looks and feels great in your hand and I found I couldn't put it down for the first couple weeks!"
569,5,Bought this phone online and picked up in store. Great experience picking up and activating phone. The new iPhone is great. Face ID works flawlessly and the new display is very impressive. I really like the larger screen in an almost iPhone 7 size. Face ID is really the best feature as I have found it to be much easier to use than touch ID. Really an impressive upgrade coming from the iPhone 7.
570,5,"I was hesitant to spend this much on a phone, as I don't use the camera much.... It was 100% worth it. Image, sound, speed, ease of use.... and I got over the notch within about a week."
571,5,"It is a step up from the previous versions. My dad bought a 8, I feel it is step up from 8. Extremely happy with the product."
572,5,"Takes a little bit of getting used to, but once You figure what swiping motion does what it's an amazing phone. By far the best iPhone I've owned."
573,3,"Phone is great. Good battery life, great camera, overall good product just takes a lot of getting used to"
574,5,"This is our 4th IPhone. It has a great camera and once you get use to it, it is terrific."
575,4,I LOVE the camera & being able to use portrait mode as a selfie & the different effects. Don’t like that sometimes the face recognition doesn’t work well & I have to type in my password more often than I did with the thumb print.
576,4,The phone is ok. I hope Apple comes out with more bells and whistles for the X. Three upgraded options from the 8 makes it not worth it.
577,4,Just an ok phone. I like it but could have purchased the 8
578,5,The phone's camera is extra ordinary esp in videos and during the day light colors are great in photos and videos. very fast phone at processing tasks
579,5,Phone has a very nice screen and the silver color looks great
580,5,"Love the phone and the screen, space grey color is also very nice"
581,5,"Ok, I’m Obsess whit apple products. . But truly is a great phone"
582,5,Camera is unbelievable. The phone size in between a plus and regular iPhone. Love it
583,5,I love the phone. Price is ridiculous but if you are thinking about it pick it up today. No disappointments here.
584,5,"Sure, it costs a lot - I was upgrading from a 5S but it is slick. Face recognition is a very nice feature (initially I thought it was a gadget feature but it helpful)."
585,5,"wow, just can't stop apple, they know how to make a great phone!"
586,5,"iphone is like a fine wine, just keeps getting better..."
587,5,"Simply the best iPhone I have ever used. Speed,responsiveness,screen color, and the camera is just great."
588,5,Like the phone. Not too large. Easy to operate with a lot of features.
589,5,Love that Best Buy has 2 in stock! No one else did. The device is great! It is smaller than the 7 plus but you don’t lose screen size. Vibrant screen. Love the new feature! Go Apple!
590,5,This phone is awesome. It takes great pictures and videos.
591,5,"I decided to get this phone because of the screen size. I am starting to get a little older so a larger screen is easier to read. I previously had an iPhone 6S. I could bring myself to get a plus because the phone itself was too big. This phone is a good size and the screen is great. I do think if you haven't learned to use reachability on an iPhone you need to research it. It is so helpful and surprised on this phone it is off by default. So no home button after all these years. It did take a little time getting use to the new gestures to get around on the phone and do the things that in the past you did with the home button. Once you learn those, you will never miss the home button again. I find doing things on this phone with out the home button seams more natural then it did with the home button. Faceid seems to work great. Just like with the finger print reader there are times it doesn't unlock, but not very often. It is so fast you unlock the phone without even thinking about the faceid part. Just swipe up and you are in. I am not going to get into the camera. It is a great camera, but I am no expert to say how good it is. It takes good pictures for what I do."
592,5,dont listen to the hater reviews ! try it and learn ! its very easy to adjust to it and makes its real easy ! i do youtube vids on popular electronics and got over 2million subs and this phone is awesome ! face id works fast and easy just try it ! the top notch dont hate it its just weird if u zoom into vids but u get use to it ! the home button u gotta miss it the couple 1st days but u gonna like the fast swipes and multi tabs ! and many new features !
593,5,"It is incredible that Best Buy has gotten me my iFhone X UNIV, I’m happy for that; informing me at every moment of the process of my order until it is in my hands, the attention that has always characterized them for years that I have been their client. Thanks Best Buy"
594,5,I have had an iPhone since the first generation and this is the one that I have been waiting for. I may even keep it past my 2 years...we shall see.
595,5,Upgraded from an iPhone 6 and love it. Great performance and FaceID is a great addition
596,4,"Is not a bad phone just to expensive , I just love to have new apple products and is getting in my habits now ... fake it until you make it lol"
597,5,Amazing phone with great specs and very easy to get used to.
598,5,Was looking at iPhone 8+ for bigger screen size but overall case size was just a little too big for me to pocket carry - spent the extra on the iPhone X and happy I did.
599,4,Great phone only dislike is not having a head phone jack.
600,5,"Apple hit it out of the park with iPhone X. New gestures are easy to get use to, fast phone, awesome Oled screen best on its class."
601,4,"I upgraded to the IPhone X from a IPhone 6, and I couldn’t be happier. The fact that I have more storage is a plus, but the camera is awesome especially the portrait view. Now I think the front camera when taking selfies still needs improving and I haven’t figured out if I can still take screen shots with the x, but I am overall pleased. I can swipe to navigate between open apps is another plus."
602,5,Great product and i loved it. Very very Good......
603,5,My son was over the moon with his IPhone X. Love the folks at BestBuy who making shopping for everything easier. Love all the new features
604,5,I love this phone and the facial recognition adds to my feeling of security. The phone is also super fast
605,5,My daughter loves her new iPhone. Takes amazing pictures.
606,5,"Love the screen size and clarity, especially given my not so great up close eye sight. Kids want one now too."
607,5,Owned Android for years. So far am very pleased with the IPhone. Easy to use and looks great.
608,5,"Former Android owner. 1st IPhone. Like the look, feel and operating system."
609,5,Wireless charger is easy to use and you can take it anywhere.
610,5,"When comparing at store level phone seemed small, once I started using it and comparing to others the screen looks much bigger."
611,5,"I haven’t used all the features just yet, but it has been a pretty cool device so far."
612,5,Best phone ever nice screen and comfortable size the best
613,4,"I like the phone overall. But sometimes the opening and closing of apps can be a problem. Also the screen rotation feature doesn,t work as well all the time. And the face ID can be a pain to use."
614,5,An iPhone that is different from all the rest. Been with droid since 2008 and the transition wasn’t so painful.
615,2,"It works and can make calls, play on line and go into chat rooms and stuff. Always talking with hot chicks with this phone."
616,5,Phone does it all and is fast doing it.... love the face scan
617,5,Face recognition makes it worth every penny! So cool! Love it!
618,5,"As an unapologetic iPhone user, this phone is what I waited for after my 6+. Near identical screen real estate and excellent new features."
619,5,Love the X...the camera/picture quality is amazing
620,5,At the beginning I did not like it but when I use for couple days I start to like it It’s different than normal iPhone I like it
621,5,Purchased for my daughter and she loves it. Of course it’s a new phone so it’s the greatest thing ever
622,4,Pros: Face ID works well and is convenient. Full face screen is a very clean look. Resolution/Clarity/Color all beautiful. Speakers at both ends of the phone make noticeably better sound when watching video. Operating without a home button does not take long to get used to. Cons: Still photos are less impressive than expected. Do not match the photos of the Samsung Note8. Very easy to take accidental screenshots.
623,3,"For being the new IPhone ""generation X"", it has a slow processor & the camera has a delayed caption..."
624,5,"The phone is all I expected and more, out of this world screen res."
625,5,"Not enough characters to describe this purchase. Had a 6 and it was past time to upgrade. Was hesitant but this baby is FAST. It's awesome, it's slick, it's innovate. BUY IT NOW."
626,5,I am so glad that I upgraded love the big screen bigger than the 8+. It took a little getting use to not having the home button but I like it better now
627,5,I loved my microwave oven and the hood over my range
628,5,Upgraded my iPhone and couldn’t be happier. The X is everything and more that you want from Apple
629,5,I love this phone just like all my Apple phones. It does take some getting used to with the removal of the home button but once you get used to that I have no complaints.
630,5,"All is good, can’t complain, wife is very happy, she love new phone , I very happy with Best Buy the seller is very friendly nice guys, help a lot"
631,4,"its very slippery & heavy & thick, theres a learning curve its hard to get use to no home physicall button.. face id is ok also hard to get use to altho the screen is full its not bigger just has more free finger space. they eliminated the alarm clock icon and bluetooth indicator its on the control panel screen and no more battery percentage % either. wtf? its also a two handed phone not good for teens with small hands .. the glass back and silver buttons are beautiful but will be covered by a non slip case. the glass back seems to be scratch proof however the phone wont sit flat due to the camera lens... setup is amazing and the x will communicate with your old phone just by placing them together wirelessly.... my favorie iphone is the 7 the x is good... 4 stars not 5"
632,5,Greatest iPhone yet! I love everything about it. Amazing display
633,5,Love it probably best phone ever as always excellent service from best buy
634,5,Camera is amazing. I thought I would miss the fingerprint scanner but Face ID works even better
635,4,"Works great except that yesterday I did have an issue where each time I taped the phone icon an opaque screen kept coming up with barely perceptible characters behind it. I could not acess my phone contacts or keypad until I finally turned it off for a minute and the back on after which the phone worked perfectly. I was able to receive calls during this glitch but,not make any."
636,5,"Beautiful phone, what else can I say?! Previously ordered through Att but I have been waiting almost 3wks and my ordered hasn’t shipped. Decided to try Best Buy and they have it in stock! Got it on Black Friday!"
637,5,"The iPhone X is a sleek new device. The Super Retina(OLED) panel is amazing, the colors never fail to impress me. Although the phone did have it's fair share of controversies at launch, like any Apple phone. They were quickly resolved and the phone was proven as a great new phone to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the iPhone."
638,4,The iPhone X has been fun to use. The Facial recognition is faster than I thought it would be. The learning curve has been minimal. Haven't played around with the camera much as yet but it has been nice thus far.
639,5,"Best iPhone yet, glad i waited the last few years to buy this one."
640,5,I recently upgraded to iPhone X even though it seemed little too expensive. I wanted to have most up to date phone especially Apple phone. So far I am really enjoying features this phone have and excited.
641,5,Very similar to the iPhone 7. Only recommend if you have a really old iPhone
642,5,"The smart phone on steroids!!! Oled screen is awesome! Camera is bad to the bone! And to top it all off besides the facial recognition and fast processor, huge viewing screen!!! I’m a iPhone geek for life!!!"
643,5,I bought mine on thanksgiving night and this iPhoneX is great the camera and video are amazing.
644,5,the display and the faceid makes you stunned and love apple as always.
645,5,"I absolutely love everything about this phone! Took some getting used to, but it’s amazing!!!"
646,4,Takes a little getting use to great camera and awesome screen
647,5,I highly recommend the iPhone X. It is one of the easiest phones to use and produces most spectacular photographs.
648,4,I’m really feeling my new phone at the moment. The look of the phone is really nice and easy to use.
649,5,Always have liked Apple products and always will. The iPhone 10 was my next step and I am glad that I made the upgrade as I like its new features.
650,5,I WANTED THE BIGGER SCREEN WITHOUT THE BIGGER 8 PLUS SIZE..
651,5,"I may be a bit biased as an avid apple product fan, but i feel the new look and design has finally caught up with other models. However the quality of the software and hardware will never be matched by other brands."
652,5,I always liked Apple products. I like my new iPhone X. I got it less than a month ago and still learning all the features.
653,4,Siri doesn’t always work. Battery life is awesome. Love the screen. Perfect size.
654,5,Have had no issues with the iPhone X and highly recommend this new iPhone.
655,5,I love this product. I camera is awesome especially the facial recognition.
656,3,It’s to small and no option for a larger screen. Coming from a 6s plus to this and wish I had just kept my 6s plus. The facial recognition works okay. Except when power is low. Haven’t noticed any other features being anything worth having.
657,5,Very very very good peso I like it than any other I phone!
658,5,I was worried I would hate the changes but it great !! Went from a 6s to this and it is awesome! Camera is unreal and I love the Animojis
659,5,"Upgraded from a 3.5 year old iPhone 6. The best thing about this phone is that its overall size is barely larger than my old 6 yet the screen is about 95% the size of my wife's 8+. Larger screen, small package. Face ID is nearly instantaneous. I thought it was a gimmick at first but now that I'm used to it, I don't even think about it. Just pick the phone up, swipe up, and I'm in. I have a 7 for work and when I pick it up, I realize how much I love not having to ever fiddle with the home button--for anything, ever with the X. Screen is amazing. Camera is amazing. I will likely be with this thing for another 3.5 years and I'm fine with that."
660,4,"I JUST PURCHASED THE IPHONE X ON SATURDAY. SO FAR, I LOVE ALL THE FEATURES IT OFFERS!"
661,5,It was time to upgrade my son’s phone. He’s had it now for 4-5 days. He is extremely happy with the new features. The facial recognition is pretty neat. Now I have to get one for my 14 year old daughter.
662,5,"It was hard to choke down the price tag, but bumping up from the 5s to the X was a great choice. The camera on this phone is amazing! That alone is worth the price. And I don’t miss the home button like I thought I would. I’ve been using the phone for about a week and I’m really happy with it so far."
663,5,The new X is very aesthetically pleasing. The pictures and videos it takes are very high quality and the full-frontal screen makes is very nice. It is very fast compared to my old iPhone (iPhone 6). We’ll see if it stays fast once the new iPhone comes out...
664,5,I’m enjoying my new phone.
665,5,"First, the service - it is wonderful. Be it in person at an ATT store or on the phone, the treatment is cheerful, helpful and timely. My plans keep improving with every ""visit. The iPhone X - BEST iPhone yet (and I've had EACH one sine #1 - even the 8 plus). Keep up the great work ATT."
666,5,"After getting used to a couple tweaks Apple made (like no home button), loving the new X! Just wish they would make a Mophie for it, as I use it for work and hate having to rely on plugging it in to charge it."
667,5,"It took me a while to decide if I wanted the IphoneX or the 8plus. A friend of mind explained it this way.. If you like shiny new things and do not mind paying the price for the X then go with that if you want the same phone as your 7 but newer and a bit more updated then go with the 8 plus. Well I like shiny new things and the newest techy things available so I went with the X. I love the camera, the clear crisp pictures it takes. The face recognition is very cool there are other features that I am expressed with as well oh the battery life I find last longer than the Iphone 7 I had. Overall I am very happy so far."
668,4,"Like all the other iPhones that I've owned, this phone functions perfectly. I've even got used to working without a home button fairly quickly. My only negative opinion at this time is the missing zoom for texting and the icons on the home page. That was a great feature on my other iPhones and can't think of a good reason why this feature was discontinued on the iPhone X."
669,4,Love the phone and it’s upgrades however it is so fragile and difficult to find a minimalist drip proof cover to cover all of the front screen including over the raised glass (fragile) to meet where the screen saver ends. I don’t know why Apple chose to design it this way. Also as it is made of glass on front and back I would think more of the aforementioned cases would be available but they are not. I used to love Tech 21 but they don’t fit bc of the front screen design. Also it is so small I have difficulty locating it esp in my purse after using my Uphone 6SPlus and I wish they offered it in the Rose Gold color.
670,5,It is hard getting use to the New IPhone and it’s features so many to choose from but now that I have gotten use to them I am absolutely in love with it and if you come right down to it it’s the best IPHONE EVER if you reading this definitely buy it and Apple isn’t playing me to say this I have always had an Android phone and I like them but my Iphone is the best phone I have ever had !!!!!!!
671,5,Love it! Best iPhone ever.
672,5,Phone is awesome and customer service at store was great!
673,3,iPhone needs to make a few improvements. Can’t close apps while on a calls .. multitasking not so friendly
674,5,"I love it, it's amazing! Great phone highly recommend!"
675,5,Amazing pictures! Love the phone
676,5,"When I started setting up the phone, it was much different than the 7. No center control which I thought would be a challeng. What I learned, it is so much easier. Love the phone. You will love the camera"
677,1,"The iPhone X is really a piece of garbage that is filled with ridiculous and non-intuitive maneuvers. It constantly freezes-up and presents a very frustrating user experience, especially if you are somewhat of an expert using smartphone apps. DO NOT GET SUCKED INTO BUYING THIS!"
678,1,It’s a pretty phone but way overpriced especially considering you don’t get anything nice like AirPods or a quick charging cable. I had the s8 and it cost much less and came with a quick charging cable and good headphones (apples suck). Save yourself money and get more and get a galaxy s8.
679,5,O my I’m in love with my X iPhone apple did they thing with this one... I did a great job getting this one
680,5,"It’s basically a more badass iPhone than the previous models. You want the latest and greatest, get the iPhone X. Face ID is just one of the many features that I personally love."
681,5,"I love the phone, the features I am still learning how to navigate but not much difference. The transfer of data was so easy, it was amazing. The whole face recognition, i love that to unlock the phone. Looking forward to what else this phone can do."
682,5,The best iPhone I am glad I made the switch fast pictures are great love it.
683,5,Great phone upgraded from the 6 easy to use have to get adjusted to having no home button
684,5,I love it this phone its very nice
685,5,I’m totally in love with this iPhone X
686,2,"The swipe down from upper right of the screen is the main change i don't appreciate. The volume in maximum mode is WAY too loud. I have anxiety and jump when my phone goes off if its at max volume. The change from ""Wednesday"" to ""Wed"" on the calendar app icon is not necessary. And why isn't there an AM or PM for the time while I'm in the phone? The absence of a headphone jack is depressing."
687,5,"Didn’t think that I would like this phone when I first got it but I so love it now. Still getting use to the size. Much small than my IPhone6s plus,"
688,5,"So many great things about iPhone X. I debated upgrading, but am so glad that I did. I’d recommend this phone to anyone who is looking to upgrade or switch from an android."
689,1,"The phone is larger than all previous iphones, however the screen is more narrow. When I watch landscape video, the screen size expands until it either hits the top and bottom, or the sides, or both (this is normal function), in landscape the video expands until it hits top and bottom and leaves over a 1/2"" of dead screen on each side. this means I am looking at a screen the same size as an old iphone 3 or something. it really really stinks. the narrow screen and resultant small landscape video size is a deal breaker. they can have it back. everyone I show this to is stunned."
690,5,"I’ve always been an iPhone guy Pretty much had an iPhone all the way through the 6. This one though (the X) is awesome The camera alone is on point. No more home button though, but like my boy Forest said “One less thang”. I love it."
691,5,I’ve only owned the phone for a week and so far so good. The camera on the phone is a big step up from my 6s and there is a very noticeable improvement in battery life.
692,4,"I think for the price that you pay for the phone, Apple in my opinion did not change much to warrant the excessive amount that they want to purchase the phone. I should have just got the iPhone 8 or 7."
693,1,Not happy with iPhone X and setup
694,5,The new iPhone X is more just a great phone. AT&T paired with the iPhone X it almost like the two are a step ahead and ready for your next need.
695,5,Been an iPhone user since the beginning and now it’s even better than before. Enjoying the new features and cool gadgets that it came with. Worth the purchase.
696,2,I’m surprised it didn’t have better features. I switched from the galaxy s8 to the iPhone X and the galaxy had bed features and was way more customizable.
697,3,Processor sucks after a week
698,5,The new iPhone X is a beautiful clean bright design. The new display is gorgeous. The new functions are intuitive. Battery much better.
699,5,The is a very nice phone and im glad I upgraded.. camera and battery life is great but i do feel my phone service and internet is slow
700,5,I am enjoying this new phone. The safety features of the facial recognition is truly awesome. I highly recommend purchasing this one.
701,1,Not happy with the polity of the phone and what its potential shielding the hype is over ratef
702,5,I purchased the IPhone X and an IPad. That was the best deal ever. I walked away with not only my IPhone but also an IPad which is what I had been wanting for a while now. I love it
703,5,Simply amazed with my iphone x battery life is amazing smooth running and just in awe
704,5,I love my IphoneX ! I think its the best investment I have made.
705,5,Excellent product and It easy to used it
706,5,Excellent product and easy to used it
707,5,I love it! The phone picture quality is so awesome.
708,2,I am going to return it and get the 8 the only difference about this phone is the home button is gone and the facial recognition. Since I am use to the the Plus this phone is also too small.
709,5,I absolutely love my iPhone X. It’s the best iPhone yet!
710,5,"So far I’m pleased with my phone, display and features."
711,3,the brightness is terrible. Not light enough
712,5,I love it!!! Love the camera.
713,5,Best upgrade to the iPhone X! Face recognition is fantastic. Best screen and audio of any iPhone!
714,5,I usually don't write reviews and how this helps someone out. I've had iPhones since the very first one and battery life has always been the biggest issue for me as I use my phone all day for work. But the iPhone X has an incredible battery life. Now I can use the phone all day and at midnight still have around 30-40%. That alone justifies the price these things cost these days!!
715,5,I love everything about it. There is a learning curve but I'm getting used to it. I am terrified to drop it though.
716,3,"So to start with, don’t get me wrong, it’s a beautiful phone. However, for the price point, it was way overpriced. If you have an iPhone 7 or 7+ then truly the upgrade is not worth it I had an issue with my 7+, but I wasn’t real happy with, so this was a forced upgrade. So quite frankly, I don’t think it’s worth enough bread for my iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. I would probably wait a year."
717,3,"I don’t think it’s worth the money. I’ve had it for about a week and it’s still updating my information on it (music, etc). The camera is better than the others but not as great as it’s advertised."
718,5,"This is the best iPhone yet, I love the Face ID. My son had one 1st, once I saw his I had to order mine."
719,5,I bought this iPhone X for myself and it is super great!!!! I upgraded from iPhone 6p and you can really see the difference in speeds. The menus change very quickly and the 4k ultra on the video is fantastic.I like the full screen across the phone as well. You cannot go wrong with this iPhone.
720,5,AT &T delivered the Iphone X less then 48h. I used the app to buy the phone and the experience was amazing. About the phone? It is an Apple of course. I am so impressed with the phone.
721,5,I really like my new iPhone X I couldn’t ask for better.
722,5,"I’ve had iPhones for past 10-11 years and this is by far, the best one! It has beautiful resolution, easy touch screen, incredible pictures, everything is flawless. Siri is much better than ever. I am in love and recommend this phone to all!!"
723,5,Perfect size phone excellent perfect is all I can say
724,5,"I went from the 7 Plus to the X and it took a little while to get adjusted to the smaller overall size especially the keyboard. However, the device itself is smooth, the response is excellent and it appears to process data, etc pretty quickly. This phone would be perfect if they made it in the Plus size but overall, I like it alot so far."
725,3,"It’s okay. Trying to get used to not having the home button. Face recog is nice, but haven’t noticed much else that’s better than the 6sPlus I had."
726,5,Easy to learn! Love everything about the phone!
727,4,So far it's been an amazing device. I'm personally an Android person but my fiancee is in love with his new phone !
728,5,This phone just topped all phone out there with cool new features and thin slick design.
729,5,"At first sight, the well known notch design appears to be highly unattractive. However, once the device is in hand, you begin to notice it less often. The fact that one can hold their smartphone in one hand again without sacrificing screen real estate is fantastic! The new iphone X feels and is premium all around! The new OLED display provides a rich and vibrant viewing experience without emitting overly saturated colors, camera technology is out of this world, speed is completely insane, and the battery life is much better than expected! Sure, the iphone X isn't perfect in every way possible but is indeed a step in a new direction; revolutionary. This is by far the best iphone to date and I'm sure it's only going to keep getting better! -Harmonious"
730,5,"This phone is SUPER fast. If you think it the phone will already complete the task. The touch screen is awesome and great display. I do NOT miss the home button at all. Face recognition is SUPER fast and more reliable than finger print. The only issue is that you have to hold the camera just right for it to recognize facial id, however the only time this is an issue if the phone is on a desk or something."
731,4,"Even though I was not going to purchase the X, my 6s died. I’m happy now due to the larger storage capacity and larger screen with smaller footprint. Only problem is all my earphones are now unusable with this phone without the adapter."
732,5,Best display best camera best processor best software best App Store
733,5,"I am absolutely thrilled with this phone! I was a little hesitant at first - converting from an iPhone 7, but the lack of a home button has been no problem at all! It is super easy to use, the camera is phenomenal, and there are lots of neat little features I continue to discover! I would recommend this phone to anyone considering an upgrade! The larger screen is amazing!"
734,5,This IPhone is great enjoying the easy usage with the facial recognition feature
735,5,"Where do I start? The ten is here and it lives up to its name. The facial recognition feature is a determined leap forward in iPhone security, as surely as the iPhone 5 was with its (then) revolutionary thumb scanner. The elimination of the home button will take some time to adjust to, but adjust you will. The downside of the upswipe to switch from open apps and windows is that to close them becomes a three step process. First the swipe up to view them all, then the depressing of one to prepare some (or all) to close, then finally depressing the red dot close tabs on the corners of the windows. This is at least one step too long, and something I expect the engineers at Apple to rectify in the future. As for the camera, you get what you pay for (in this case, handsomely) from Apple. And, as always, it is nothing short of the current state of the art. The iPhone X has set a new standard in how to deploy pictorial splendor from your pocket. The photos and videos you will record are absolutely breathtaking. This is quite simply the new bar that all other smart phone cameras will be judged by. The portrait mode is in a class by itself. Also included is an updated Clips app that now boasts some augmented reality for your enjoyment. As one would expect, there will come a time when this current incarnation is revealed to be crude and ancient, but for now, it’s quite satisfying. The screen size, is just large enough to take advantage of the superior camera the ten boasts, but still respectful of the constraints of the pockets most of us will be fishing this device in and out from. While the price is extraordinarily steep, it is a worthy successor to Apple’s rich history in setting the standard in smart phones. The X is here. It is a ten."
736,5,Very impressed thought I would miss the home button but not at all!!!! By far the best phone I have ever had. Was scared because of bad reviews but they were all wrong! Great phone
737,5,I love the talking emoji. The photo movies. The live pictures. Easy to use highly recommend
738,4,I buy two iphone and one does not turn on and the other one when I'm using some app it shuts down
739,5,It takes some getting used to but the phone is pretty good. But I would have been just as happy with the 8.
740,5,The technology is just simply awesome! First of its kind.
741,5,"I love the IphoneX!! At first, I didn't see the differences. When I started to explore and get used to the phone, I realized how much better the display, graphics, camera, speed, and features are! I'm so happy with my new phone!! I love it!!"
742,5,Great features! Easy to use and great for pictures!
743,3,I didn’t like the phone. I was use to a larger phone. I didn’t like where the Siri button Was.
744,4,"For the most part I like my new iPhone X, the only thing I don't care for is how difficult it is to shut down."
745,2,Still freezes. Needs more work. Screen don’t react as fast and colors fade
746,5,"For my daughter for Christmas, she loves it. She especially loves the quality and high level of technology that the camera has. She also uses it with her virtual reality set. It is awesome."
747,4,"First: the buying process was painful - waited for nearly an hour for anyone to sell me the product. Then, all they tried to do was upsell, trying to talk me into things I didn't want - terrible. As for the iPhone X, I like that the screen covers nearly the entire front of the phone. The cameras are great, and there are some other nice features. On the downside, I would prefer a little smaller overall size - more like the iPhone 7 or 8. Also, the phone gets hot when making a call or other use for more than just a couple minutes. Definitely overpriced but, I still bought 2 just because I wanted the latest model."
748,1,I was talked out of the iPhone 8 Plus for the I phone X don’t do it. The face view barely works and the missing home button is frustrating. The phone freezes never had these issues with the other I phones.
749,4,"Very nice phone, not quite worth all the fuss....or the price Face ID is nice but not much better than fingerprint I’d."
750,5,Love the seamlessness of the facial recognition. From opening the phone to paying bills is super easy and fast.
751,5,"Surfing the internet is really truly fast almost like using mynhome pc. The text to speech is very accurate. I travel theu the US and the screen does not freeze like people wore claiming. Which was why I waited to upgrade and i travel to places that are -25 degrees. The facial recognition makes it easier to open my phone and you can incorporate it into most apps for ease of use. The camera takes awesome pics and its an all around pretty phone. Big screen enough to watch movies but also compact enough to text with one hand. I Love this phone and it takes care of my personal, financial and work needs. Plus large capacity storage for the size."
752,5,I had a Samsung Edge 7.Ive been a Samsung fans for as long as I can remember.Switched over to Apple and I don’t regret it nothing against android and I still love Samsung but I totally love my IPhone X by far.
753,5,I went from a 6 plus to the X. I love it.
754,5,"This is a beautiful phone. It’s not really an issue that there is no home button or headphone jack, as swiping up from the bottom works perfectly to take you home, and Apple includes earbuds that plug into the lightning charger port in case you don’t have wireless headphones. The glass back, front screen with curved sides, and bigger picture all make this a beautiful object, though because it is so incredibly expensive, you will probably want to put it in a case and put on a screen protector, which will compromise its beauty. The camera also takes gorgeous photos."
755,5,Upgraded from the iPhone 7 even though I did not need to but did it anyway: battery is as good as my 7 and it is just an awesome phone. I am very pleased with my purchase even though the price could of been lower but overall- Nice phone
756,4,I love this phone it is very different from the other phones and it took me a minute to get used to.
757,5,"Great phone. Smooth, fast and battery lasts all day."
758,5,Great phone. Very fast and reliable. No complaints so far.
759,1,Way to much more work to operate than older iPhones. Huge disappointment! Don’t waste your money/upgrade!
760,4,Only had it about a week but it seems to be great. Very easy to pick up all of the new features. Seems like I’m still learning more every day.
761,3,"The phone itself is amazing the problem is the battery. I have to have the brightness almost all the way down and can’t really mess with it very much in order for it to last the whole day. It’s a powerhouse phone though, just be prepared to be chained to a wall outlet."
762,5,I am an 84 year old and I just love this IPhone X. Best of all is the face recognition and being able to use Apple Pay.
763,5,Love the phone it has great battery life !! Nice and sleek fit!! Face ID is super amazing quick and easy to access the phone. The switching around of the features definitely gives it a level up its still the same iPhone just with a twist it made it fun to relearn the functions of the X. It made the experience new completely. I am taking it for what it is and enjoying it Apple is truly THE BEST
764,5,I wish the phone came as a plus but I like it. Apple has out done themselves once again! Great features & the face ID is pretty cool. And the camera is freaking awesome!!
765,5,"I have to say I myself am very impressed with the iPhone. For those coming from anything “plus” yes it will initially feel smaller. But you will quickly find that you fall in love with the speed and easy use of the phone so that you stop noticing the size difference. The screen is the most crisp it has ever been, with a beautiful display. If all else falls just open the camera... apple has truly outdone itself with the best camera to ever hit a apple device."
766,5,The screen is awesome. Love that it’s the same size screen as the 8s Plus but the phone itself is the size of the 8s. the pictures are super clear and crisp. And i like the new features of no home button and the talking emojis. Lol. So much fun. I hate the hefty price tag but i do love the phone.
767,5,It’s everything the other kids want plus some
768,5,This is by far the best iPhone apple has ever came up with! It has everything an iPhone does and has those features of the Samsung we always wanted all wrapped up in th X!!!
769,5,Excellent phone! Love the new full screen!
770,5,"It’s great, screen is increadbly sharp easy to see and phone easy to hold with one hand!"
771,4,I love my new phone! Other than my Face ID doesn’t really work in cold weather.
772,5,"The battery life is good , easy to manage, good camera and lots of new features that I still need to learn."
773,5,I really enjoy the new look of the iPhone X. I really enjoy having the facial recognition. I am glad that I went with the iPhone X. I highly recommended this phone for both the young and young at heart. It offers something for everyone. I definitely don’t want to forget about the battery life on this phone-its great.
774,5,"SO easy to use, love teh new features. Very happy with the upgrade"
775,4,Great screen. The camera and supporting hardware is far and away the best feature of the phone. Very fast hardware overall.
776,5,"Having owned several smart phones starting with android. I made the move over to the apple ecosystem several years ago starting with the iPhone 5s and have had a few hand sets 6s and se. I love how everything about iPhone just works. There was no looking for alternative apps or tweaking a setting to get things to function. With this phone I already knew it was great looking, but what I’m amazed at is how great and intuitive it really is. The loss of the home button you would think would limit functionality or find yourself missing the center piece of apples iOS hardware ui. This is not the case I find on my other idevices I try to use the touch only interface of the iPhone X. Tap to wake, swipe up to go home, or swipe on the charm bar to seamlessly switch between apps it’s great. Battery life is stellar especially with the stock all black apple wallpaper, thanks to the new oled display. FaceID works quickly and accurately, and I love that notifications on the lock screen are in private mode until I look at them. Just a great user experience and why I rely on the apple eco system of devices. Display ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Camera⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Speed⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
777,5,"Same old iPhone like usual, nothing really new but a much higher price. I do love the screen and how it’s fully fulfilled. I love the camera and the Face ID works flawlessly. It’s very responsive and it’s definitely worth the extra money for it."
778,5,I absolutely love it! The display is crystal clear and the camera takes fantastic pictures.
779,5,Inreally like this phone. Its not too big and not too small.
780,3,"Have had iPhones since they first came out , from the 3 to the 4s and then the 6 plus , upgraded to the X , oh boy ! Take a lot of getting use to , switching apps and closing apps , everything is different, no home button, not sure if I want to change to the 8 arg"
781,5,OLED 4K screen is awesome and facial recognition is pretty cool too
782,5,I really love my new iPhone X. I have used An iPhone since the first one came out 10 years ago. It felt like a natural progression swiping up on the screen. I don’t miss the home button at all. It’s quick and flawless.
783,5,"Beautiful, easy to use, faster, many things of new staff"
784,5,"Is like having a personal computer fully loaded on your pocket, love this phone"
785,5,"IPhoneX is absolutely incredible, ANY bad reviews must be from people who either don’t know what they are doing or have buyers remorse because it’s costly, but it’s worth it."
786,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus to the iPhone X and love this phone. It was an easy transition from the 6 to the X and you will get use to the new features quickly. I was torn between the 8 and the X but I'm happy I decided to go with the X
787,5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
788,3,I have been using iPhone since 7years. But this time I am Facing lot of issues in screen rotations & Face ID is bit slow. Not up to the expectations.
789,5,I love this phone. The size is the perfect balance for someone who loves the bigger look but enjoys the slightly smaller size. The interface is surprising easy to learn adjust to. The camera is an amazing upgrade! I love using all the different features to enhance the photos of my family.
790,3,Face detection vs finger print reader isn’t even close. It feels like the product was rushed to bring to market without a home button. Lots of things are good about the phone but LOTS of bad. Screen is great however the gestures could be a lot better. The phone feels like it questions what you want it to do. Flipping between apps takes more time. Unlocking your phone when you’re not looking right at it isn’t great.
791,5,"Highly recommend the “X” ... it takes some getting use to without the home button, but the learning curve if you’re an avid iPhone user is fairly quick. Processor is super fast. Camera’s photo quality, as expected, is somewhat disappointing."
792,1,"The phone is average. Photo clarity is wonderful, however my phone keeps freezing at the home screen which throws me for a loop. Overall it’s average to other iPhones."
793,5,What can one say about a beautiful phone? I am a die hard iPhone fan and I have been in the AT&T “next” program for a couple years now and when this phone came along I of course jumped at it! I love the new screen real estate and it’s smaller size overall..( my previous phone was the iPhone 7plus) which was a bit too big! This phone is also faster and has loads of useful features! The only complaint I have is that a few of the hidden features are not explained....for example...if you have the phone in your hand and it rings ...the volume drops really low...almost to the point of being a “whisper”...I thought the phone was defective so I made the AT&T person prepare a new phone for me only to find out that the new phone did the same thing! (If the phone rings while it is NOT in your hand the volume is as loud as you set it! The idea I guess is that you don’t need it blasting in your ear if you already know it’s ringing! Ibfelt that the sales person should have known this instead of making me spend another hour activating a different phone!
794,5,"After having all of the iphones, Apple did it Right with this one. The Iphone X is wonderful.....great display, easy to use and a great sleek look. There is a little bit of a learning curve, learning the way of using the phone but its very simple, once you get the hang of it. Totally recommend this iPhone!!"
795,5,I did the upgrade as a Christmas & Birthday gift to myself. Still learning all of the ins and outs but so loving the new unlock system .... FACE RECOGNITION.... XOXO
796,5,Will be even greater as soon as I figure out how to use all the wonderful things it does. Lol Still working on that
797,5,"Phone is awesome, service is better!!"
798,2,"I don't really like the IPhone X. If I wanted an Android, I would have bought one. I wish I would have kept my 7+. It is not user friend, I hate freaking swiping. Bring back the fingerprint recognition. Most offices do not allow cameras."
799,5,Everything so far is great
800,5,"Love the slickness, the photo recognition,"
801,3,"I have been an Iphone user for 5 years or so. The X is my third Iphone. I love the size of it and my 4 year old LOVES the animated emoji thing. The camera is really good, but doesn't feel much different than the camera on the 8. What is very different is not having a home button. One of the biggest reasons I miss it is that you HAVE to pick up your phone to access the home page. You can't just put your finger on the home button to be recognized. You have to pick it up so your facial recognition will work. One other thing that I don't think any of the engineers thought about - SWIPING UP FOR EVERYTHING CAN CAUSE FOREARM FATIGUE! Think about it, pressing a button with your thumb is a lot easier than moving your hole thumb 1 to 2 inches up 1000 times throughout the day. I have had the phone for 2 weeks or so, but I have noticed that on days I've used the phone a lot that my right forearm is tired. All in all it's a cool phone. But I wish they had left the home button alone."
802,5,"pics are much better, learning how to use it still, Face ID is the great it works in the dark, I was impressed"
803,4,My iPhone X is just ok. My battery life is poor. My battery dies fast. I can’t listen to What’s App voice note messages while I’m on a call. My phone seems slower and I’m not sure about this phone. The pictures are ok nothing to brag about
804,5,"I went to this from a 6 and no matter what, transfer from one phone to another is never seamless. The biggest thing is no more finger prints! So everything you get into with a fingerprint, you need to remember the password to. I locked myself out of 3 of my accounts. That was a pain, and not every app does facial recognition so be prepared to change passwords, which isn’t a bad thing really. Getting used to swiping everything is easy once you know how and which way to swipe. No home button. But it is easy to forget once you get used to swiping. Battery lasts all day. Big plus. Fast. Bigger plus. I am enjoying getting to know the X."
805,5,So far il lovei it. It was a little hard to get use to no home button but once you do its really easy. I dont usethe face recognition bc id like passcodes.
806,5,"The Apple iPhone X is an Amazing device, so many features, so much capability. I was skeptical about using facial recognition at first but now I’m sold. The only negative thing I can say is, there aren’t many AR apps out there, but that’ll change"
807,5,Great phone it works great
808,5,"What can I say? State-of-the-art device that leaves the competition in the dust! It’s everything you expect in an iPhone and more. Facial ID is the bomb while screen size is (in my opinion) optimal though smaller than the iPhone 8. I say optimal because at some point in the evolution of smart phones as the screens get progressively larger the device ceases to be a phone and becomes a tablet or mini-laptop. If you want a phone buy an iPhone X. If you want a tablet (or larger) then buy that type device and “enjoy” lugging that around. As for me, the iPhone X is easy to see with unmatched clarity, and is easy to carry on your belt or in your pocket (or anywhere else you desire) without toting some sort of “brick” around with you."
809,5,All my life I had been an android user but once I made up my mind to get the iPhone I couldn’t be happier. The only problem I have is the music.
810,5,"Was a little insitated to change my iPhone 7 Plus for the X. The best decision ever. At first was confused always looking for the home button. But after a day, I dont even miss it. So flawless and smooth, everybody complements the phone and pictures taken with this phone. Also don’t need to recharge the phone during the day, the battery last the entire day even using social media and texting a lot. Love it."
811,5,Takes some getting used to but pretty neat. Love the face Recognition.
812,5,The iPhone X is a great phone. The camera is so much better than my iPhone 7 was. The Facial unlock feature is so easy to use. Call quality is wonderful. I highly recommend getting this phone.
813,5,Love this phone. I like that it’s small enough for one hand but has the camera of the plus.
814,5,The phone is amazing. The only thing I don’t like is the way you completely close apps. I like the swipe up method better than the hold down and X out of it. Just takes longer and is more difficult. The batter life is phenomenal and the facial recognition is awesome. Just an overall amazing phone.
815,5,Upgrade from 6+. Like the new OS with the new device. Easy transfer of data. Went to productivity immediately. Not missing the home button at all! Multitasking smooth. Figured out how to close apps very intuitively.
816,3,I should have kept my Iphone7
817,5,This is my 4th iPhone. Definitely each one has made great improvements. Love everything about the phone including the shiny silver. I think it’s a classy phone. Great photos!!
818,3,"It feels the same as every other iPhone I received. iPhone 6s is a great phone and I regret paying this much money for an iPhone, I will never do it again."
819,5,"Confusion why they changed to Roman Numerals for this one, but; one step closer than not having to think what you want the phone to do"
820,2,"Too soon to be regretful, but I’m not impressed."
821,5,My husband and I both got the new iPhone X as a Christmas gift to each other. We both are very active and use them for work. They are fast and love the Face ID log in for access and our apps. Camera is amazing and the features create beautiful picture options. Still learning all the great new features but so glad we got them.
822,1,The phone has so many issues. It freezes. The touch sensor goes out so when that happens there’s no access into your phone. ATT has been zero help. This occurred 2 days after I purchased my phone and they will not fix it or exchange it. It lags. There’s just better quality phones than this one.
823,1,Not real impressed. Camera isn’t that great and apps keep locking up.
824,5,The iPhone X is remarkable! It is technically sound and has features second to none. The facial recognition program is the best I’ve seen and it’s superior to the Samsung 8 plus. You won’t regret buying the iPhone X model!
825,4,"Great picture quality, siri sucks, easy, convienient"
826,3,Feel like the phone is good but doesn’t live up to the hype or price.
827,5,I’m not by any means an Apple cult member. I own all PC computers and I detest iTunes witj a passion. I got the iPhone X Because I was due for an upgrade from my 6+. So just to let you know this thing is great. Slightly smaller size I thought I wouldn’t like but it really fits in the hand much better and all the new gestures make this thing great for a single thumb use. And the battery life is amazing. Go ahead spend a lil extra you’ll be glad you did.
828,5,Love the facial recognition over the finger print especially when logging into apps very pleased with the upgrade from the 7 plus
829,5,This one is everything Apple saids it would be. Incredible
830,2,"I am not impressed with this phone. I got it to replace my S6 because it was acting up only to discover they slowed old phones by design. This will be my last iPhone, and likely my last apple product."
831,5,Upgraded from an iPhone 6. Love the X! You get used to no having a home button in 20 minutes. Face ID is great. Very fast. No regrets.
832,3,Seems slower than old phone and not as user friendly
833,5,It’s truly and amazing phone I thought it would be horrible but you have to try it out yourself to enjoy it befor you give it bad judgement
834,4,"Was a d bout android user,preferably Samsung.Had so many Robles with my 7edge that I decided to give igneous a try.So far,so good"
835,4,"Great changes. Takes a bit to get use to, however this phone is fabulous!"
836,5,Works great! Like the big screen without the bigger plus model!!
837,1,Phone has a lot of glitches still. AT&T states it’s due to the new operating system. Regret is definitely kicking in...
838,3,"The phone has much room for improvement. It has locked on my twice. I can be texting and all of a sudden, the screen goes back to the home screen and I have to start over. Closing programs can be a hassle if you don't swipe just right. Sometimes this can take several attempts."
839,5,"Amazing phone. I love the face recognition, speed and all the features. Best phone I've ever had."
840,5,"When I saw the first ad for the iPhone X I was like I want that phone. Now that I have had it since the release date I love it but at first I was like oh my what have I done.but I’m happy I stayed with the x. People complain apps are not setup to take full advantage of the x , sadly they knew this going in. Yeah it’s not as big as my 7 plus but you know over all it seems to be a way better phone. The call clarity is amazing. The battery life last a full 2 days for me. The screen is breath taking. And people keep saying the phone is fragile I don’t see it I have dropped mine from waist height about 6 times not even a scratch or crack"
841,5,"I have just gone from an iPhone 4s to the iPhone X. It is like learning all over again what a iPhone can do. With the help of my granddaughters (10 & 12) I now feel pretty comfortable with the new iPhone X. However, there's still a number of things I need to learn before I consider myself confident to explain them to others."
842,5,"I have always used iPhones and the ""X"" is the best iPhone yet..."
843,1,"It's Terrible. Everyone that I speak to (on the phone) says that it sounds as if I am underwater before the crackling begins and I have to hang up . Now, I have to return the phone within the 2 week window of purchase which is a real inconvenience for me as I have a broken leg that I can't bear any weight on."
844,5,This product is awesome! Love the facial opening it is fast!
845,2,More hype than substance. While the facial recognition system is nice performance is lacking. Phone connection is not clear. Have many complaints that I can not be heard when calling others compared to my old iPhone 7plus. Despite the hype screen size is underwhelming. Improvement on the top & bottom of screen is ineffective when watching video. Width significantly smaller than iPhone 7+ that impacts reading. (See Photo). Best feature is the camera that allows greater control. Multiple consumer reviews state it is the most breakable phone ever. Finally uying experience was dreadful. Miss days when customer service personal instead of dropped internet connections. Plans that promote free upgrades are worthless when new phones work less effectively than ones they replace.
846,3,"Overall pretty good. Nothing extravagant. If you are accustomed to an iPhone plus, I certainly would not recommend. The full screen feature is overrated and pretty much for the home screen and some videos on you tube. If the X came as a plus, I'd certainly get it. I think the advertisement for the full screen effect is misleading."
847,4,"Simple to use and worth the cost in my opinion. There is always room to improve, but it genuinely great."
848,5,Wonderful phone love it using it is so easy and simple better than iPhone 6plus
849,2,"This is by far the best IPhone so far. I love everything about it, it is so smooth and so awesome to use! I am so happy that I have this phone and I recommend anyone that is deciding between the IPhone 8 and the IPhone X to get this phone! Actually, I recommend android users to switch to this phone, it is much better!! Oh and the speed is AMAZING, so fast!"
850,5,I thought that the X would be hard to operate because I had become really accustomed to the 6 Plus and didn’t really utilize that device to the full capacity but I am enjoying getting acclimated with the latest technology that Apple has released with the X. It’s definitely a great toy to have.
851,5,By far the best iPhone made to date. Transition to face recognition and lack of home button was super easy and took very little time to adjust to. Simply awesome!
852,5,"Easy to use, comfortable to carry, powerful and fast (96 Mb/sec on 100 Mb/sec WIFI. Camera has awesome capabilities - still learning all it's features. The transition from the iPhone6 was easy...no glitches."
853,5,"Upgraded from a 6s. Love the face recognition. Using the phone is different without a home button, but easy to get used to. I had to google a few things like how to shut it down, screen shots, and how to close apps. The face recognition with Apple Pay is very cool. Face recognition doesn’t work unless your eyes are open and you are looking at the phone. So it feels more private than with the fingerprint scanner. I chose the silver phone because it looked awesome. But the front and rear of the phone are glass. And it is super slippery. So I looked for a clear silicone case to show off the phone but also keep it safe. Overall very happy with the new iPhone."
854,5,Great phone notch doesn’t bother me. Got use to the phone in two days. I’m happy
855,3,"Tons of features but impossible to share with people that have not equal technology. Impossible to upload on Instagram or FB great videos, too heavy. The camaras are great but when using block itself and I needed to shut down completly the cell and restart to continue using. So, too expensive and it works so-so. Not very happy."
856,5,"I love my iPhone X- 256GB, very easy to use and so much faster then my other iPhones I have used in the past."
857,5,"I’m so happy to have this phone, I’m very please with it"
858,5,I love ❤ it!! It is simple to use and different at the same time..
859,5,The I phone x feels completely like a different phone. I love the facial unlocking. I love the swiping apps. I do love the fact that the button is gone and have fewer steps to open. I love how my life proof case fits the x. The look it has. The screen is larger than bigger phones. I just love it.
860,5,"While I was ready for an updated iPhone since my 6+ the reviews made me hesitate. All poppy cock! You will not miss the home button or the frame surrounding the screen. In fact, not only do you gain more screen real estate than a plus the iPhone X is narrower and fits easier in the palm of your hand! Furthermore, the face recognition feature is faster and more natural to navigate than the home button. I adjusted to the change in less than a minute. Sexy to hold, navigate and see with a camera/photos that will blow you away. Joy to the world. Thank-you Apple!!! LOVE!"
861,5,"What a great phone, the best that I ever had"
862,5,"Took a hot minute to get used to the navigation, but the corner to corner screen is awesome! The phones battery is the best any iPhone has had, it’s sleek, and the processor is faster as well. Glad I purchased this over the 8 or 8 plus."
863,5,This phone is amazing!!!! Best iPhone yet
864,5,"Great phone, easy to adapt to the new features."
865,5,I love the iPhone X my only thing is I thought it was bigger than it was and I wish I would’ve waited for the X Pro that’s coming out at top of year. It’s the big version 6.5 size. But far as the phone itself I never had a better phone
866,5,"I’ve been a 10 year Samsung user. I fell in love with this iPhone after a few minutes. I actually just upgraded to a note 8 in November but liked this phone so much that I decided to add a line and get this one. I don’t even touch my note now. Although, it takes me about an hour longer to change my iPhone 10 than It ever did to charge my note. Get the fat charging cube and it will shave some time off of having to wait for a full charge. It’s got a few bugs with compatibility issues, like with he Fitbit, and my gotomeeting call in audio, but other than that I love it. The way to close out of apps is awkward, as well so if they could change that it would be perfect."
867,4,"Big upgrade over my IPhone 6s, but very pricey. Needs to have lower price, Apple isn’t hurting that much. Notch on top is very distracting, needs to go on future models. Apple needs to figure that one it. Pretty loyal Apple consumer, nice to upgrade but could have had a lot more improvements. Also needs to incorporate a stylus like Samsung, believe me would sell like crazy."
868,5,This iPhone X is the best iPhone I have ever used and owned thanks
869,5,"Beautiful, Fast, User-Friendly. The only challenge for me as an iPhone user was getting used to the swipe functions instead of the home button. It only took me a few hours of usage to get past that and acclimated to the swipes. Great phone!"
870,5,Simply the greatest piece of tech out there at the moment!
871,5,"The FaceID works great and gets better as more apps support it. The size is an improvement over the 6 Plus, with bigger screen on smaller phone. The processor is so fast I had to adjust my gameplay on Angry Birds. Can't rate the camera (so I hope it doesn't give it 0 stars) because I have not taken a picture but did play with the optical zoom and it is very good."
872,5,The latest iPhone is always nice to have. The facial recognition is a major plus. I have working hands. So the finger recognition on the 6s+ was not always adequate. Even with or withought me glasses the facial recognition still recognizes my face. The new camera fetures are a major upgrade as well.
873,4,"It’s better, but not by much comparing to Iphone8+. I was looking for something extravagant about it but I cannot find it."
874,5,I love new iphoneX it’s technology is undisputed it’s my little personal computer away from home. Crystal clear images and beautiful pictures i can’t put it down.
875,5,"I haven't had the phone long, but I already like it more than the previous phone (which I did like a lot). The new ways of doing old things are pretty easy to adjust to and the new things are very cool."
876,5,iPhone X is absolutely wonderful. It has things much better than iPhone 7 we traded in. We bought 2 ea one for my wife and one for me.
877,5,"Not having a home button takes a little getting used to, but after just a few hours, it felt comfortable. We bought an Iphone 8 at the same time and getting it set up using the home button felt awkward and clunky compared to the X. Also, facial recognition is much more of a big deal than I thought it would be. Just having to look at the camera rather than use a fingerprint is much more convenient. Concerns that I had read about problems with the recognition working at angles or in total darkness turned out to be non-issues. Battery life could be better - a lot better, really - but I'm able to get a full day of heavy use out of it, so it hasn't been that big of an issues for me. Overall, I'm very happy with the phone."
878,5,Great phone I love it very nice and works great
879,5,"I didn’t think the value would be worth the cost. But, this is a wonderful tool!! Moving around is a lot easier!"
880,5,"The iPhone X is a great phone. The sleek design and the full screen is incomparable to all other iPhones. The only thing con is the face recognition . It’s not as easy as putting your finger to unlock . You have to look at the screen or be facing toward it . So for those of us who like to unlock our phone while our face is buried in a pillow, it makes us get up and face the screen. Other than that I love this phone and glad I got it"
881,2,"Voicemail does not work. Just a shame. Year 2017, latest IOS - this is greatest embarrassment I could've imaging. Had problems with contacts and backups. Bad error processing."
882,5,"I was hesitant on purchasing the new iPhone X, I thought the lack of a home button and the new Face ID would be a disappointment. Days before receiving it in the mail I wanted to cancel My order because I was convinced I would not like it. Every time I used someone else’s x I had trouble understanding its functionality. One day after transferring over the the x I couldn’t be happier. It really is the most amazing phone. Everyone that had one was trying to explain to me how amazing it is but the point is you can’t explain it. You just have to use it. It becomes an extension of you."
883,5,Phone works great Swipe works better than the home button I think Love the new design!!
884,5,"I have own previous I Phones, and when I up graded they always have newer technology. The I phone X has by far leaped in keeping with today's demands. AT&T has treated me and my daughter very well. The employees know their stuff."
885,5,"really like all features ,but one. The ringtone is not loud enough to hear well."
886,5,The iPhone x is awesome does more than I have ever seen a phone do before
887,3,I only did it for the 2 for 1. It is ok but it takes for ever to download emails and sometimes other data.
888,5,I had an iPhone 6plus it was huge I love this x
889,5,Excellent I will recommend to everyone.
890,2,"I had high hopes for the long awaited iPhone X. I must say that I am disappointed with lack of new features. The only new feature is the Face ID and perhaps standard camera upgrade. Otherwise there’s nothing much different than the 6, 7 or 8."
891,4,"I really like the new iPhone X. The functions of the phone are great, the one thing I’m disappointed in is the screen size. It’s not as wide as my iPhone 6s Plus, even thought the screen stretch’s the whole length of the phone everything on the screen is smaller. It’s hard to go backwards. I hope the next phone out is bigger."
892,5,I enjoy all the features of the iPhone X.
893,5,"Face ID is nice , go get you one ASAP"
894,5,Amazing technology. A huge leap forward
895,5,This phone is a great. All that needs said.
896,5,everything I would expect of an iPhone and more.
897,5,I’ve had an iPhone on and off since 2010. I’ve been the girl who would go back and forth through Samsung and iPhone. And overall I’m sticking with iPhone. I just switch from the note 8 and even though I lived the note 8 I had to go back to apple and get the X ive had this phone for a week and I am very impressed with the phone. The Face ID works great even in very low light. It’s worked about 98% of the time which was about the same for me as Touch ID. Of course when it does work just put in the passcode. The phone fits great in my hand. I like how it’s small like the 8 but the screen is BIGGER than the 8 plus even if it doesn’t seem like it. The cameras are amazing as usual and the Animoji feature is so much fun. I did have a slight problem after the 3 day. The screen went black and took 10 mins to turn back on. I was about to return but I realized it needed an update and it’s been working fin ever since. I do think the price of the phone needs to be lower and it was hyped up a little too much but over all I love it. Ppl wanted a change from apple and now they got it. Just keep in mind that no phone is perfect.
898,5,"I bought the X after having a 6 Plus and have been very happy with it. The size is better, it looks better with glass on the front and the back and the functionality is easy to grasp. One of the aspects I like is the removal of the home button. It used to get fingerprints on it and wouldn’t work so I had to use the passcode which was a pain. Now, I just hold the phone up and it works due to facial recognition. If you are willing to pay the hefty price tag, I highly recommend the iPhone X."
899,5,If you can afford it why not have the best out! Love the video and Steady shot in the camera and video
900,5,"Love it! It's taking some getting used to using facial recognition while using Apple Pay, clicking the side button twice first is awkward. Otherwise, it's great."
901,5,Best iphone ever! Great upgrades and fastest it could be!
902,5,"I love the new Apple iPhone X. I love all the new feature and how easy it’s to use. It’s the best iPhone yet! Camera is heads and tails better than my 6S. No more blurry pictures. Love, love, love it."
903,2,I didn't like the iPhone X I'm glad I returned it it was disappointing all the way around I went back to my plus size iPhone 8 plus I love it way better only thing was good about the iPhone X was the speed and camera all the hype is gone about the iPhone X as a iPhone user if you love the plus size stick it with it iPhone X will not be for you.
904,5,I really love how fast it is and the wireless charging option is great
905,5,Phone is simply perfect. Best phone ever!
906,5,Great phone Worth the wait Had not upgraded since iPhone 6 plus
907,4,"The phone freezes up quite often, did a update on it hoping It would fix the problem, but it did not. Other then the freezing up the phone is pretty cool"
908,5,"Love the format, the size, battery life and everything else!"
909,5,"I’ve been with Apple since day 1 of 2007 and the X is by far the best phone to date for sure!! No matter what people are saying about the 7 plus being bigger it’s def not,just read the specs that should be enough right there and all the great new features that come with this phone are fantastic if your due for an upgrade get the X you will not be disappointed,don’t be fooled by the bunk reviews the X is by far the best Phone on the market today!!"
910,5,"I think this is a really good phone. It took some adjustment to my habits, but I am glad I made the switch from the iPhone 7. Face ID works every time and is MUCH faster than Touch ID. New features like the camera and the hard-press keyboard functions are great. Screen is much bigger, so one-handed operation is harder but I never did that much anyway."
911,5,"Before I bought the IPhone X I read almost every review I could. I saw people complaining about the phone size, the screen size, the durability, and the fact that some apps don’t take up the whole screen. WELL I went from the iPhone 7 Plus and I love the phone being small with the screen being bigger I can still see the same as I did on the 7 pulse but I also don’t have to worry about it not fitting in my hand very well. I’ve already dropped this thing twice and there’s nothing wrong with it at all (I don’t have the glass screen protector and a speck case though. Also most of the apps do fit to my screen perfectly the only one I have seen not is my schools app which makes sense cause they probably aren’t to worried about updating it just for the new phone. I love this phone though very easy to use, really cool features, and the camera is TO DIE FOR. I really like not having a home button, it actually makes it easier and the facial ID works really fast."
912,5,"So, First before i start my review i think its important to understand that reviews are not the end all be all of products and services, but they do provide sort of a glimpse into certain aspects of what to expect and potentially look for. All in all its up to the consumer to decide whats best for them and what they like. With that being said, ny personal opinion on the Iphone x is that its great!! I have been an Iphone user for close to 10 years now and haven't had any issues with any of them as i have not had any issues with my 10. I have had my phone for a week now and am really enjoying it. What i appreciate most about apple products is the simplicity of use. Apple really simplifies everything and it makes for the most seamless experience when it comes to their devices. Does it always come out with a new feature first? No there are several other devices that have features that apple doesn't have and features that apple has added that have been around for a while i.e. wireless charging and face recognition. Apple gets killed because it doesnt always come out with something first. Thats not a bad thing to not be first all the time. When they do reveal something its again in a more seamless and strategic way they makes it effortless. if you are looking for a quality phone then the iphone is a solid choice."
913,1,"I have been trying the iPhone X for several days, upgrading from my iPhone 6 Plus. While it has some cute features, there is not enough to justify the price tag. I'm not sure there is enough to justify a lower price tag. The screen is smaller than my previous phone and requires two hands to use most of the time. I am returning the phone to try and find one with the simplicity I enjoyed."
914,5,"I can't understand the negative reviews. I have owned every I Phone since their inception. The I Phone X is hands down the best to date. Maneuvering the screen is slightly different but you adjust quickly. The home button is actually an improvement in my opinion. Facial recognition took less then 2 minutes to set up. Additionally facial recognition is quicker and more efficient then the old thumb print on the home button. Battery life, so far, is outstanding. My other I phones I was charging every 12 hours or so based on my usage. My I Phone X is being charged about every 24 hours. A major improvement, although my results may not be typical. Buy it I don't think that you will have any regrets."
915,5,After first week forgot how use and hold Android good work.
916,5,This phone is perfect for me. I upgraded from the 7 plus and the phone is smaller so it fits my hand better but the screen is actually bigger than my old phone. Gaming and sound quality is outa this world.
917,5,The best cellphone in the market for now for the smart phone i we’ll definitely like this one
918,3,"I had my phone for a week so far I’m not impressed with the service I’m getting I’m not sure what’s going on it always searching for service when trying to use the internet or social media, even in the city I have issues with it loading today I recieved a text message 40 min after it was sent to me, my iPhone 6pus had better service than this one, going in tomorrow to see what att could do about it or return it"
919,5,I’ve had the phone 2 days so far and I’m liking it a lot.
920,5,"Love the facial recognition, large screen on a smaller phone than the 7+"
921,5,"Phone is all around incredible. Ridiculous 4K recording. Best battery i have had, better than galaxy s8 plus by a ton"
922,5,I’m loving this actually. So easy to use. Learning more everyday I use it. Way to go Apple. You’ve done very well with this one
923,5,Upgraded from a 6 plus and love it!
924,5,I love the iPhone. My only gripe is waiting for shipping but this phone is a amazing. The AT&T rep Hosh was so helpful and that was amazing.
925,4,The slide & facial recognition is super and so much easier to use and user friendly! Can’t see why anyone would waste money on an 8 when this technology seem to be leaps and bounds ahead of the 8!!!
926,5,"I owned a iPhone se came to iPhone X the improvements are speechless, I am in love with my new iPhone X. Never in my life was I excited about a phone till this one came out! The speed the graphics it is without a doubt the greatest phone of our time."
927,5,This is by far the best iPhone ever and it will get better as more updates come
928,3,"Apple would have you believe that this is the greatest smartphone ever, with the largest screen of any iPhone. But that's not quite true. Measured diagonally, X has a 5.8"" screen versus the 5.5"" of the 8S. But you have to knock part of that off because the ""horns"" are unusable space in your apps. What you end up with is a screen that is slightly taller than the 8S, but also slightly narrower. You have virtually the same amount of screen. Unfortunately, watching video in full screen leaves a section cut-out on the side or the other option is to center the video, giving you a much smaller viewing area with black bars on all four sides than if you were watching the same video on the 8S. The build of the phone is trumped-up to be ""surgical grade steel"" and ""the hardest glass ever on a phone."" Watch the drop-tests to see how easily the glass breaks and see how slippery the ""surgical grade steel"" is to hold onto. You will definitely want a case for your handset. Break the back of your phone? Apple will charge you over $500 to repair it! While the processors and memory run quite efficiently with IOS (the best feature of an iPhone), IOS itself has become buggier with each iteration. Autocorrect has gone bonkers with IOS 11, autocorrecting words for no apparent reason or changing letters on you. It's great that Apple has ""gotten with the times"" and offers fast charging and wireless charging. Unfortunately, the charger included in the box isn't a fast charger - there is a separate charge for that. Same goes for the Wireless charging. Apple is really pushing AR (augmented reality) as if they invented it. AR has been around for years and is much simpler than VR (virtual reality). You've probably been using AR for years without even realizing that is what it was. Such as apps like Messenger or Snapchat putting hats on your head or making you puke a rainbow. Or hunting Pokémon where you see the Pokémon in the real world through your camera's viewfinder. Yep, that's AR and it's been around. When Apple lets you strap a VR headset to your face and explore get back to me. All in all, the phone is a nice next step from Apple and they are finally getting with the times. But it's not the greatest phone ever made nor the greatest iPhone ever made."
929,4,"What can I say.....it is a really nice device. Does it live up to the hype, I am not sure just yet. With all of the tech, it will be a device of the future. I have not had any issues with the face ID as has been reported on a few reviews. However, need more apps to be updated to take advantage of everything the phone can do."
930,5,"This is a great new phone and the path to the future. Cool new features (I know Samsung had most of them already), but now Apple does it with flair. If you don't like change, you wont like it, but get used to change!"
931,3,"Awesome phone, but it is not worth the money that the phone cost."
932,5,I heard all whistles and bells regarding the IPhone X and was a little bit hesitant of the needs to upgrade from my IPhone 6 plus. Unfortunately I dropped my IPhone 6 plus and now was to make a decision of fixing it or getting a new one so I ordered the new IPhone X. The delivery was fairly fast and by my surprised I was soon to find out that the upgrade was very much noticeable. This phone is the best IPhone ever and do bring a great advantage in the market. this is my experience I do not want to bring technical review but you should do your homework. I chose the 256GB considering that many apps are getting bigger the lower option might not be enough memory by the time I paid your phone off.
933,5,I have been happy with my phone. Was very easy to set up and easy to use. The camera is awesome
934,5,I love this iPhone! The size is perfect and the camera is awesome.
935,5,"I’ve had every iPhone since the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone X is been best! I love the full screen, Face ID, and new gestures."
936,5,"Fast, sleek and reliable! While appealing the eye, the function of the phone is on point! Love the convenience of face recognition, speed of processor and the entertainment of the virtual emotions!"
937,5,I love the iPhone X! Not hard to use especially not haven’t the home button. Only issue I see is the speakers. They are not as clear as my previous IPhone 7 and I hear this cracking/popping sound. So weird.
938,5,Apple has done it again. 4K 60fps 4K 24fps no one has this not even super expensive dslr’s. Screen is the best in the industry colors are spot on. I love how it fits perfect in my hand. It is the perfect balance of size and screen realestste. It doesn’t feel overly big tlike the 7 plus did. This phone is a straight monster in performance destroying everything in the market. Face ID is spot on and the gestures are super easy to learn people just don’t like change and complain. Is it worth the money? Yes it is the camera alone is worth the price having all of the shooting options right in your pocket. Well done Apple.
939,3,"After using it for a week, I’ve discovered that I miss several aspects of the IPhone 7 Plus. Miss the battery percentage being available on the top right corner without having to swipe. Miss the home button and it’s double click features. Miss the full screen without the camera affecting the view amongst other small but significant things."
940,1,Hate the size!!!! Way to small compared to the iPhone 7 Plus.
941,5,Legit phone no bad aspects
942,5,"I recently pre-ordered the iPhone X 256 GB on October 27th. It shipped on November 7th. I was so excited about the phone that I picked it up from the post office. I took the box to AT&T store and it was activated right out the box. Let’s get to the point, the phone is very nice, sleek, and sexy. It the Face I.D works just as good as Touch ID if not better. The technology they put into making this device is extremely powerful and accurate. This is the iPhone I’ve been waiting for since 2007. The camera on this phone is superb and does so many different things. Facial recognition is even tied into your emojis which is nice. The battery life on this phone actually is very good. It last me the entire day and some with moderate to heavy usage."
943,5,"People can talk about how Samsung has been the pioneer of new advancements in next gen phones; that might be true, but you can’t compare to Apples reliability and durability of their phones. I’m contastantly asked to use my phone because an app/battery doesn’t not work on a Samsung phone. The iPhone X is a beautifully design phone. The battery/processor/camera stand out. I was skeptic about the Face ID, but I love the fact I can just log in to anything with just my face."
944,5,Everything I expected and more!
945,5,Worth every penny. Easy transition from the 6plus to the X.
946,4,It’s a good phone but. Bit confusing.
947,5,"Having had every iphone since the first, ands few Galaxy phones as well) I can honestly say that the iPhone X delivered on all fronts. The screen is exceptional to look at. The keyboard seems a little small coming from the 7 Plus. The notch is a non issue during use. Many apps have not optimized for the use of the entire screen and screen dimensions. I think in short term the little quirks will all be worked out quickly by the app developers and Apple. I am very satisfied with the speed of the phone. And the video and picture quality is top notch."
948,5,This is the best by far Apple has done in a while. Other then the durability issue. This is a flat out win
949,5,I upgraded from a 5s. This phone was worth the wait and learning more features on it every day. It’s a 10plus for sure!
950,3,"Most durable glass ever? I laugh! Attached is a pic of my iphone x right out of the box, i cant speak on anything else as i have not even turned it on."
951,5,Excellent phone works really well especially in the dark the face recognition is amazing. compared to the other phones they did it a little better on the battery. love this new phone.
952,5,If u like apple. This is the best there is. But if your a andriod person you will always hate the iPhone.
953,2,"I upgraded from iPhone 7Plus and I am regretting it. The X is very small compared to 7Plus and holding the X simply is undesirable. The keyboard has entirely too much wasted space and still without multitask keys. FaceID works without any issue and is quick! However, the bottom line is...it’s still just an iPhone"
954,3,"I am no average reviewer; I worked as my companies phone manager for over 2 years so I have used every Samsung from S4 up to every iPhone ever made. Pro’s - Great Display. - Size is perfect. The standard iPhone is too small but the plus is too big. - getting adjusted to no button was easy. - Battery lasts longer. - Animoji’s are cool and I know we will have some cool AR apps that yse this tech. Con’s - Price is too steep - Fragile phone. Now I haven’t dropped mine but I did see the test on durability and this phone failed. - Lots of apps don’t use the full screen. - The keyboard is still too small. - Auto correct has a glitch in it, and cannot be used. - Animoji’s freeze or don’t work at times. - sound switching is still an issue - Facial recognition doesn’t work all the time. - Siri still isn’t very smart. I asked her what my email address is and she told me she ran into a problem. - Copy and paste still isn’t better than the Galaxy. - Finally price. This phone has an inflated price point."
955,5,"Beautiful phone. Nice feel to it, good size and overall happy with my purchase."
956,5,"Just one word, Amazing , great design ,great Screen, loved the new improved OLED screen, Camera captures the intricate details , high resolution pictures and videos . Face ID works smoothly , easier than Touch ID to setup. Animoji is fun. Moving towards the future, this iPhone upgrade is definitely worth it . Apple has always been an innovator. Great Product. Hands Down iOS."
957,4,"The iPhone X is great so far, only one crazy glitch, the volume turns up on it's own after about 5 minutes of listening to music. Does it every time, volume just doubles all by itself...???"
958,5,"I absolutely love this phone !! I wasn’t planning on getting it but when I saw it in person and played with it my jaw dropped . Absolutely amazing !! Super easy to use . I thought I wouldn’t get used to not having the home button , the thought scared me but it’s super simple to go back home. The screen is huge! The battery life is super long . Super clear videos , and the pictures WOW Amazing!!!! I love it !!! Best purchase ive made!!"
959,3,"As I stated in my first review, the screen is too small on the X, about the size of the iPhone 7. I know the specs say 5.8"", but there is an upper and lower part of the screen that acts like a bezel and is not used. I had to set the AT&T sales people straight and show them the 8 plus has a bigger screen! The keyboard is quite larger on the 8 plus, as it is wider!"
960,5,If you are looking for a new iphone experience the X is the way to go i know its expensive but i think its worth it
961,5,This phone felt weird at first but it felt better after every hour of owning it. It’s amazing!!!
962,4,"All in all very good iPhone. A little different on getting around, but changes are welcomed. Facial recognition works great. Only issue so far is brightness changes even with auto bright and true tones turned off."
963,5,Apple still makes the best OS and best devices.
964,5,"I am more than pleased with my new X! I previously had the 7 plus which I loved BUT the X is the perfect size to manage with one hand again which is the one thing I missed going to the plus. No home button, no problem, it was a quick and easy adjustment. I only miss the percentage option for battery indicator. OVERALL SOLID DEVICE! I’ve had every phone since 3g iPhone!"
965,5,This is an awesome phone. My favorite to date.
966,4,iPhone X is a step above the rest in terms of camera and screen! Videos look awesome and wireless charging is super convient! Expensive device but At&t always has awesome promos!
967,5,"Everything in this phone is amazing the pictures,the face recognition I’m in love!!!"
968,5,"This phone is awesome!!! I love the slimness . I can reach across it with one hand. I love the glass & chrome, very unique . And I don’t miss the back button at all . I have a clear case so I can see the phone . And the Animoji’s we have laughed till we cried lol plus I’m still learning lots of fun & interesting things about it everyday."
969,3,"I love the screen and clarity. But I’m having a hard time letting go of my iPhone 7+. I thought the camera on the X would be as good, if not better than the 7+ and the flashlight is no where near as bright as my previous iPhones. Not having a button is actually a nice change. I Like the simplicity of swiping to open and close apps. The new iOS is an improved change too. The only issue is moving items around in settings. No one should have to google how to as an email account to an iPhone of they already own an iPhone. Nor should you have to open every tab trying to find where that feature has been moved. Overall, I like the X, but I’m still on the fence about keeping my 7+. I’ve got 11 more days before I have to return it. Hopefully the good will outweigh the bad."
970,5,"Still playing w/it. However, I can say that I miss the home button. Don’t really care for the side button function. But will see, I’ll give it a little more time."
971,5,"Got this on launch day and honestly can’t believe how much I like it. First, the camera is amazing. That alone is worth the change. Having a screen that is essentially the same size as my 7+ in a phone that fits much better in pocket. Best smartphone yet."
972,5,Love the full screen and size.
973,5,A awesome phone with outstanding results...
974,1,Responding to comments from my earlier post. The iPhone X is just to smal especially if you are used to having the plus model iPhones like I have had. Why spend the extra money for Face ID and Animojis??? The new iPhone 8 and iPhone X have just topped the charts as the most fragile smartphones out!!! And they are by far the most expensive to repair. In my opinion they aren’t worth the extra money. I’m a true Apple fan but the new iPhones have let me down so I will be keeping my iPhone 7 Plus and jumping ship to the Samsung Note 8. I have faith that Apple will do the right thing and make a plus sized iPhone X next year but until then I won’t hold my breath
975,3,"The phone works good, my only issue with this phone is the size of the screen. The screen on the X is about the same size as standard iphone 7! Why am I paying more money for a phone that has smaller usable screen area than my old iphone 7 plus? I will be returning this phone and getting an iphone 8 plus! This is the most disappointing iphone yet! I will keep my 8 plus, until they make a X-Plus!"
976,5,Love the phone so far. Have nothing bad to say.
977,3,Way to much money for hype that just isn't there returning for a cheaper same quality phone.
978,1,"Within an hour of getting my phone and setting it up I saw it. There's a 8mm semi-circular crack in my ""gorilla glass"" screen. I didn't notice it at first until I took the phone outside to play with the new camera (which has so many lens flares that are another issue entirely). With the screen illuminated, it's barely noticeable. A phone Of this level should have higher quality standards. I went to the AT&T store and they said they couldn't help me, to take it back to Apple. This is unacceptable in a new product."
979,3,I love the iPhone X other than it’s size. I am a diabetic and can not see very well. The IPhone 7 Plus with large bold text was perfect for me. I can barely see to use my X even with glasses. Unfortunately this is a disappointment to me because there isn’t a PLUS option for those with difficulty seeing well like myself.
980,1,I’ve had every iPhone since 2007 and this iPhone is by far the most overpriced overrated iPhone ever. I used the phone for only an hour before boxing it back up to return. I’ll wait for Apple to come out with a new plus sized iPhone X. Until then I got a Note 8.
981,5,"Calling the iPhone X a “phone” is like calling an automobile a seat. You can sit in a car, but that understates it’s full potential. The iPhone X can make phone calls, but that’s only a feature. The iPhone X provides worldwide access to the 54 integrated services offered by Apple. Anything that I can do with my iMac, MacBook, and iPad, I can do with my iPhone X, but only the iPhone X allows me to do it outdoors in the rain."
982,5,The phone is smaller than my 7 plus but the screen is larger. So far I love it. YouTube videos can been seen full size you just need to swipe the screen from inside out to widen it to full screen. The X is fast and the facial scan works great so far.
983,5,"I am one of those folks upgrading from a plus device (6S plus), so the smaller form factor took some getting used to. The phone is definely narrower but the screen is big and beautiful and to me the size of the phone is perfect. I was mainly concerned that face ID wouldn’t work as well as the finger print reader. It works great! (Makeup, no makeup, glasses on, glasses off, hair up, hair down). It recognizes me and can tell the difference between my daughter and me (we look a lot alike) easily! The phone itself is gorgeous, it’s a shame to cover it up with a case. But it is glass, and I watched all those dropping videos showing how bad they shatter when dropped, so I will definitely use a case. The OLED display is amazing. Colors are definely truer, and black is really really black. I thought the notch would bug me, but it doesn’t. Overall very very happy with the phone and feel lucky to have received it on launch day!"
984,1,"On you tube you can’t get full screen , and many other applications , this phone is good to upgrade from the 7 not from the 7 plus they should have made x plus"
985,5,Face recognition is awesome. Love the screen and the size is just right.
986,3,I'm really disappointed on how small this phone is considering that I've been so use to my 7 plus! They really fooled a lot of us with that but other than that it's okay I like the Face ID and camera/features are better! Hopefully next year we get a Iphone X plus lol
987,5,I like it it’s new it’s kool been an iPhone user since 08 by far my favorite iPhone camera is amazing so glad att saved my spot to preorder glad I didn’t have to wait until December
988,3,"Pros: Phone design is good Cons: Face ID doesn't work all the time. But, when it works it is extremely fast Videos doesn't come in full screen Hard to resist to not press home button if you have been an iPhone user all along Lot of bugs in this release"
989,5,"what an amazing iphone this is, i believe its the android killer iphone X is the best thing since sliced bread its the best ever period lightning fast the pictures the video is stunning love the new ring tone... iphone X is so much better and smaller with bigger screen thank you and love you Apple"
990,5,"After almost two months of using Face ID, it's clear this is one of those innovations that's immediately both intuitive and invisible, and will eventually prove indispensable. It's at it's most convenient when you've got wet fingers, as that would usually result in many failed authentication attempts with Touch ID. However, it's at it's least convenient when wearing the darkest of sunglasses, as authentication fails more often than not (although it's fine with most sunglasses). While on the inconveniences, I've also found that touch-to-wake and raise-to-wake aren't worth the cost to battery life as the phone seems to keep waking while I'm walking around with it in my pocket. This was causing the battery to drain much faster than it should. In order to further optimise battery life I use Smart Invert to convert while backgrounds to black, as the OLED screen should be able to switch off any full-black pixels. Once enabled, triple-pressing the side button toggles it on and off so it's fast to disable it when you need to (it's only moderately ""smart"" so it still inverts the colours in most images). Coming from a 6 Plus, I much prefer the narrower, longer form factor of the X. It's a lot easier to use with one hand. The screen is also noticeably better, particularly viewing photos and videos. However, perhaps the most significant improvement is in the camera. While it struggles in low light, or zooming into long distance, in most situations it takes extremely good photos. Rather than bemoan the loss of the headphone jack, I've taken the opportunity to pair the iPhone X with BeatsX wireless earphones. Similar to the change from Touch ID to Face ID, now it's hard to imagine going back. Overall, the iPhone X is an amazing device. Given how much we rely on our smartphones, to me it's been well worth the investment."
991,5,"Don’t listen to what the tech review site says, this new Apple iPhone X has completely redesign not only what the new standard of edge to edge display should be on a phone but also the new way users interact with their smart phones. Apple sets the standard when they introduce the home button for the first smartphone in the world, and now they are first to introduce no home button for smart phone user interface. The new flow is also so much quicker because we no longer tap on the screen to perform action we now also swipe and slide which means the swipe up to go home is a natural flow. Face ID is also how the fastest way to unlock the phone and performing and ID verification. These two features are what sets this phone apart from the rest of the competitor and no doubt will be the new standard moving forward."
992,4,"Great smartphone by a great company. Can’t help but to acknowledge it is certainly overpriced, especially considering that there is not many essential accessories in the box. Also, sometimes apps freeze and one has to restart the phone. The 5 watt charger that is included is sure underwhelming. The face recognition technology is fairly great though. I would recommend the iPhone X over many other alternatives."
993,5,"The iPhone X definitely meets my expectations. It’s certainly a lot smaller than the 8 plus, but if you think about it the bezels are the size difference between the 8 plus and the X. Battery life is awesome, but it is my first day using it so I’ll see how it tapers off with use. Face ID works like a CHARM. Quick and easy. Very satisfied with Verizon’s network too, speedy and reliable. Overall I am one very happy satisfied customer!"
994,5,Love it and try to ignore how much it cost. Purchased on vacation so sightless cheaper. After picking up old iPhone 6s the new screen feels worlds better on the new phone. While the new X is noticeably heavier than the 6s the new iPhone X feels more solid and looks super chic.
995,4,So I have had my iPhone X for two months now and I love it. It took me a little time to adjust to the changes like closing apps is different and the zoom in and out still annoys me but overall the battery lasts the larger screen is good and it is quick too to open and close browsing windows.
996,4,"I just notice that sometimes the system froze. and i want to review the design of the physical phone. It is sometimes confusing which is top or bottom. Maybe i just used to the previous iphone style that there is a home button. Iphone x doesnt have home button but it screen design on top, the curve, for me is not good. I think it is better if the style of the top and bottom is the same. Just straight. I think they maximise the space."
997,4,"I had the iPhone 3, 4, 5 and then 6. I decided that was smart enough for a smart phone and I didn’t need any new phone. Temptation got the better of me and now I have the new iPhone X. Frankly I have no regrets. The new Face ID feature works great and apparently more secure than finger ID. With the Home button missing, it does take a little getting used to, but no more than couple of days. You don’t need to read extensive product manual to make the most of the phone. Just search on YouTube for top 10 iPhone X feature, and you will know most of what you need to know. The battery life is great (I understand it has two batteries packed inside) and the camera is great too. It has one of the fastest processor of any smart phone on the market and the latest OLED screen is really good. Just be careful you don’t drop the phone and crack the screen as it can set you back about $500. Is it value for money? I am not so sure about that. I think it’s a bit too pricey for a smart phone and for that reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars."
998,5,"This is the first upgrade that really makes it worh your while. Face ID works flawlessly and the new OLED screen is amazing. The battery life has definitely improved as well. And as always it’s a sleek, modern design. I would definitely recommend it! I bought the silver one and it looks great."
999,4,I was really pleased that I held out for the Iphone X. The camera is so much better and the photos look like they have been taken on a DSLR. My only quibbles are the battery life and the price. Hopefully the battery life will be improved with IOS updates.
1000,3,"$1.8K for a phone? I could build a great computer, buy a laptop or go on a great trip with that kind of money. But your are not here for that reason. You want to know whether the phone is worth the money and my answer is No. It's a great phone! but here's the thing, it's not worth the money. You are essentially getting an iPhone 8 plus in a smaller form factor. It's slower to use as the FaceID is still new and it's a 3 step process to unlock you phone instead of the 1 step to unlock with TouchID. Closing apps is a big pain in the but as you have to wait a few seconds to bring up the tabs and the hold again for a few seconds to bring up the close app icon. At least you know you won't turn off you phone accidentally though! it requires 2 buttons :P Screen is nice but viewing angle is not great compared to LCDs. The camera is super great! I love it for both video and photo. The call quality is pretty rubbish, where people on the receiving end hear you like you are living under water. Your mouth actually has to be almost touching the microphone area. Hopefully Apple figures this issue out asap as that's the primary function of the device. P.S. FaceID works with sunnies and in the dark ;) I'd say wait until next year where Apple has covered some R&D costs on the new form factor and lower the price of the new gen iphone."
1001,5,"A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine. New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts."
1002,5,I was unsure if I was going to really buy an iPhone. Been a android user for a couples of years and the system was just slow and cracking all the time. I decided to give it a shot and it turned to be the best decision I could have done.
1003,5,"We own 2 of these (wife and I) and have owned Iphones from the very early days. ie: iphone 3 onwards. We didnt get the 6s or 7, instead moved from 6 & 6plus to two X's. I must say, this has definitely been their best so far. Like the saying goes, new brooms sweep well, although the new features and improvements over their previous models is remarkable. The face recognition is fantastic, so much quicker and gets even better with lots of apps adding the feature as time goes. Camera just blows everything out of the water. Even compares to my Nikon D5000 SLR, well almost ;). Always had friends hanging crap about their samsungs having a better camera, and yes they did, until the X came out. At least its now on par or even better in my opinion. One last thing, I hesitated quite a bit moving from a 6plus to this thinking I'll miss the size of screen. Not one bit, this screen is actually larger and the clarity so much better."
1004,5,"SO for starters it looks amazing then you think protection. Life proof next case $90 is a great protector then screan glass protecter $30 As it’s all glass and costs $500 each side to repair if broken. Takes amazing photos, super fast, copy and paste is annoying me it doesn’t seem to copy when you press and hold in it. All in all this is the best phone out there in my opinion."
1005,4,Has so much space!! Its really sturdy as it gets dropped by me (or my kids) quite often. I really like the no-home button home button as my last one broke. My only complaint is that it is starting to look more like a samsung/android. The camera quality is fantastic but I'm personally not a fan of the vertical camera.
1006,4,"I got this phone around a week ago, it’s not a bad phone, I got this phone because it has face recognition, and the size is good, it’s not to big or to small, I got use to the no home button as I use to use Samsung note 8 ."
1007,5,"Love my new iPhone X. Was one of the lucky ones who got mine on pre-order, so no queuing up. Easy to setup and so much easier to use and intuitive compared to the 7 and 8 series models. Highly recommend a good shock absorbing case, to protect the screen and stainless steel band. iOS 11 just makes this phone shine in so many countless ways."
1008,4,"Iphone x come out with the beautiful bezel less screen and without home button. The face id feature is good, but not perfect enough. The earphone still the same with iphone 7 generation, using lightning doc. The display is good. OLED display makes iphone X display colours more accurately. So recommended"
1009,4,"Major issues initially with the device being faulty and screen freezing etc. had to send away and 2weeks later I have it and it works great! Camera is great, few things are different so need to google how to use some things and get use to it but overall a great phone! Headphone jack is gone so plug into the power plug which is annoying but they provide attachments."
1010,5,"Great phone! I did think I would miss the home button but 3 days in i was so used to it going back to the home button felt weird. Camera is amazing (both front and back), screen quality is night and crisp. Battery is better than previous models - but still not amazing. But then again we are on our phones constantly and then get shocked how quickly the battery goes. It is a very pretty phone. I do wish if you got the silver the small amount of panelling at the front was white and my black. Over all very happy with the phone and I even pay less for it a month than my iPhone 7!"
1011,5,This review is for iPhone users or for people who wants to switch from Android to iOS. The iPhone X is the best iPhone to date. Face ID works great. The battery life is awesome and the screen is gorgeous!!! Yes it might be pricey but the build quality is up there with the best! You will love the iPhone X. I know I do!
1012,5,"Moving on from an iPhone 7, I already had a terrific phone and camera, but it's now gone to my other half. I waited a while for the new iPhone X (pronounced TEN) and I just love my new phone. I decided quite some time ago to travel without a camera, so was keen to move on to the dual lens iPhone X (but didn't want the extra size of a 7+ or 8+). I was initially slightly concerned about the lack of a home key or fingerprint scanner, but needn't have worried. The facial recognition is brilliant and almost instant, except very occasionally with too much back light. (It is certainly far more reliable than the fingerprint scanner. Of course you can still enter your PIN code if there is an issue.) A quick watch of a YouTube video taught me all I needed to know about the new gestures eg: accessing the control centre (diagonal wipe from the top right) - it is very easy to do everything without the home key, and I do not miss it AT ALL. For anyone struggling with it, watch a video and you won't miss the home button- good riddance to it. Some people don't like the ""notch"", (it's there for a reason -camera, face scanner etc) and I couldn't care less. Some people don't like change, if that were the case we'd all still be using the old Nokia Brick phones. The iPhone X is a bit different, but once you're used to it, you should love it, I do. You don't need a home button! (If you don't like change, buy an 8 or 8+, -but you'll be in the minority.) The phone works as it should, is super fast, the camera is brilliant, (LOVE the new portrait mode) I couldn't be happier with it whether photos or video. And if you're after a bit of fun there is always the animojis which are very clever, (but of no real use!)"
1013,5,I've only had it a couple of weeks but loving it so far! The oled screen is amazing resolution with crisp display. The face recognition has been working great although I do miss the home button bit. Takes some getting used to doing a screenshot by pressing volume up and power button. But overall very happy with it. Price point is too high though and they should make it more affordable in future models.
1014,4,"The screen is really clear and it's easy to get used to the lack of the home button. The Face Recognition ID is brilliant in placed of the fingerprint ID and it's a lot faster than the 6S it replaced. However, the notch at the top of the screen is truly awful and you can no longer see the remaining battery percentage, without some mucking around. Very expensive for what it is, especially for the small amount of storage it includes. Overall it is ok, but not earth shatteringly good, needs work."
1015,4,"Great phone, was hard to get use to but it’s great once you do. The hey Siri function is brilliant. The only down fall is the screenshot function which was weird to get use as I randomly would take screenshots without my knowledge. The camera is fantastic too. If you have slow internet then the phone features are less visible."
1016,5,"This is the best iPhone to date.The Oled screen is just so clear and perfect , high resolution images and the camera is just superb . the screen is a bit proud of the subframe of phone , this design is a bit fragile , so if the phone is dropped the screen will definitely be damaged .! Phone is a bit larger than previous models but . Most prized feature of this phone is the face recognition which allows the user to unlock phone and other apps ."
1017,5,"I love the look and feel of this phone. I thought that I would hate the face recognition feature but in fact it is very accurate and super easy to use, even in the dark. It is very easy to adapt to from previous models, anything that you can't figure out immediately you can find instructions online. The new photo features are great and allow you to take more interesting photographs. I love the size of the phone, being smaller than the plus versions yet have a larger screen. It is easy to manage with one hand. The swipe up feature is super easy to use"
1018,5,"I love my phone but when the Apple Store finally got stock and I went there they ran out of stock. At 9:12am!! So I went over to Myer and bought one the same day. Great service, no line up and no waiting. Now that’s a great concept. Thanks Myer. Oh and yes the phone is awesome. Love it!!"
1019,5,"I love this new iPhoneX big improvements from the older models ,it's much faster colours are brighter, camera is brilliant . It's a bit heavier than the older models but it just seems the perfect size . Yes it is over priced and to smash a screen or break anything will cost an arm and a leg so you need to consider apple care or insuring it. Battery alsts 3 times longer than my old iPhone6. I love it."
1020,5,The screen is really big. I love the brand new design. there's no home button is very cool. all you need is the gesture. it is much easier. the camera is very good too. the portrait mode give you the best quality of picture. atomically blur the background. I love this phone
1021,5,"This phone is a class act! From its beautiful sleek feel to the new face identifier to tapping the screen to open as opposed to pressing the home button, everything is seamless. The size is perfect - not too big but with the screen going all the way to the edges, I feel like I’m seeing more. Love it!"
1022,3,Ugh that missing black bit at the top annoys me. Anyone that has a X will know what I mean. Other than that everything runs smoothly. I don’t care much for the face recognition function. The missing home button was annoying at first but after a few hours I forgot about it. Got this phone because my iPhone 6 contract was finished.
1023,5,Solid phone. Using over 80 apps no lags no dramas. It might be a little bit heavy for some users. Camera always gives you perfect shots. You will aprissiate the upgrade for the front camera as well. If you like games I believe this is the most powerful device you can get at the moment. Yes it’s expensive but in my opinion I’m getting every time I’m using it what I pay for.
1024,5,"Great step up from any previous iPhone,battery is super longlife. aesthetics are really really cool, which is why most people want one anyway. Apple genuine cases are really luxurious and for perfectly. The iPhone X is a little small if your used to a plus model, but you’ll soon forget about that once you realise you can unlock the phone with a look so need to stretch those fingers. Only people not wanting one....Samsung fanboys."
1025,4,I was excited to get my hands on a full screen iPhone. My previous phone was the iPhone 7 Plus. Big difference in terms of size. The iPhone X is as small as the iPhone 7 regular size but is a tad thicker and heavier. Long ago I had the Blackberry Z10 and there's definitely a similarity in the swipe up function. The facial recognition is definitely a gimmick that people will find appealing. But is it really worth paying $1600 AUD?! I've never owned a facial recognition smartphone so yea it's pretty cool to have one. The battery life is between average and below-average. I was expecting the battery to be more impressive. I believe the facial recognition is the cause for using most of the battery life (but I could be wrong).
1026,3,"I purchased my iPhone X from Virgin mobile on a two year contract. I was looking forward to its arrival but was soon disappointed with this phone once I started to use it. The reason I have remained loyal to the Apple iPhone is because I enjoyed its easy and familiar interface since my first iPhone, the iPhone 4 but the iPhone X throws all the familiarities out the window. It’s like they changed things just for the sake of change and had a blatant disregard for the operators usability. The missing home button is painful and to do what was once simple has now become quite complicated, for example closing off apps on the iPhone X the user must slide up from the bottom of the screen, then hold their finger on the app and then close it off like they did with the ancient ios4 system. The reachability feature sucks and is far more complicated then the previous iPhones, the user must swipe from the bottom of the screen to lower the icons. I can only manage to get this right half the time and with the longer screen this feature is more important then ever. Then there is the screen quality, the screen has a yellow tint like it is stuck in permanent night mode. The facial recognition is temperamental and wastes time when it is working out if it is my face staring into the screen. They say the facial recognition lock is faster and more reliable then the fingerprint Touch ID but i found it to be the opposite. Especially because I like to hold my phone at waist height when I use it sitting down. There are some positives with the iPhone X, the battery life exceeded my expectations. The camera quality is great and the new full screen is nice but it’s not enough to keep me loyal. After years of loyalty this will probably be my last iPhone purchase ever. If I wanted to relearn how to use a phone I would have gone out and purchased a a better valued Samsung instead."
1027,5,"Where has this phone been all my life. Was abit sceptical about this phone pre realease, but all I can say is wow. It surpassed all my expectations of it and I can honestly say it is one of the best phones I have ever owned. Congratulations Apple for turning another android user."
1028,5,"The newest iPhone model is exactly what I've always wanted. It's super fast, it's sleek and beautiful. The screen is on another level, and to top it off... Facial recognition (Face ID). Face ID is a huge part of the phone which works perfectly without you doing anything. You literally just look at your phone. The phone itself is a perfect size and the battery is the longest lasting of any previous iPhone I have had. This might have something to do with the new OLED screen, which is stunning. Without a home button, there are a few new things to get the hang of, but it will happen pretty quickly. This also makes it feel more like a new phone as it's not the same old thing as the predecessors. All in all, I recommend this iPhone as it's an exceptional device."
1029,5,"What a beautiful phone! It's got glass on the back, so it is a bit heavy, but you get used to it after a while. The animated emoji function is really cute, neat and entertaining. The phone has facial recognition, so the phone is quite secure because it detects your face only. The front of the phone is all screen too. It's so nice and a good size. You won't regret purchasing this phone!"
1030,5,Best phone I have ever had. The home button may be gone but takes no time to adjust to the new ways and this is from a 53 year old. Face ID works really well even when wearing someone else’s glasses. The OLED screen is a cracker being vibrant and crystal clear. Some competitors may be brighter but then they start looking fake. Battery life is ok and must say that is the only thing that hasn’t improved. Amazes me that a high tech company like Apple can’t do bettter in this regard. Camera takes awesome shots in any conditions. Portrait mode produces great results with a definite wow factor. I also love the wireless charging and the Mophie charger I picked up from Apple works a treat. Can’t wait for the update that will give wireless charging a boost. A bigger screen and only a little bigger than the iPhone 7/8 is a real winner. Much has been said about the notch but must admit don’t even notice it. Dissapointing how expensive the phone is and in particular the way Apple treat Australia where it is even more expensive than the rest of the world. Finally you get flawless and fast performance. Great looking and high quality phone and most probably the best on the market.
1031,5,"Was able to get my new iPhone X from our local Optus store on the 3-November release date. Although it does take some getting used to not having a home button, I love the new full screen! I had the 7 Plus so the X is a bit more sleek to hold which is great, without losing screen size."
1032,5,Love this phone takes a bit of getting used too as every new phone does was so easy to transfer numbers ect the no home button iam getting used to the facial recognition I love but it had trouble in the dark . Great Phone . Well done apple .
1033,5,"Best phone I’ve ever had. Ticks all my boxes, very powerful, amazing camera, looks & feels great. Facial recognition works fast & flawlessly. Best of all it’ll be worth a tidy sum when I sell it in a few years. And the software is top notch. Fantastic innovation from Apple again."
1034,4,"Awesome new phone. It is a little on the expensive side and thats why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 instead of 5. The Camera is awesome (I'm upgrading from the iPhone 6), 256GB is a nice upgrade for storage for me as well. It has some nice new features like Animoji which I have already spent hours playing around with."
1035,4,"I have recieved this device early, I like the design, but apps still need optimization for iOS 11. iOS 11 is one of the most unstable OS I have ever seen even with a whole YEAR of development apps crash, OS glitches ad a lot more. The iPhone is good but it is not worth 1.5K. Some apps still need optimization for the top notch."
