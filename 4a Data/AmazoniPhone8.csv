"2","Apple iPhone 8 4.7"", 64 GB, Fully Unlocked, Gold","Fast and capable, but more than a smartphone alone","M. Fitzhugh","December 2, 2017",0,"Gold",5,"I purchased an iPhone 8 64 GB from Ting after using an iPhone 5C for two years. I‚Äôm finding it super-fast and enjoyable to use. The screen is bright when it needs to be and dims well in the dark. It‚Äôs beautifully manufactured and Has a great camera that‚Äôs enhanced by really solid image processing built into iOS. Without doubt, the phone more expensive than it reasonably should be, but keep in mind that when you buy a high-end phone like this, you‚Äôre paying for more than the phone itself. You‚Äôre paying your part of the cost of running a global enterprise that vets the software available in the App Store for safety, provides a global secure text and voice messaging infrastructure, and invests constantly in developing the phone you‚Äôll buy two to four years from today. Android phones are an awesome alternative, especially the mid-level phones that provide incredible hardware and software flexibility, often for as little as $250. But they‚Äôre not as joyful to use or as tightly tied to the Apple ecosystem. It‚Äôs a tough choice to make, but the good news is, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong. As someone who uses my phone all day long for a hundred different things, buying this phone was an easy call. If you just want a great smartphone and don‚Äôt care about the whole Apple universe much, then maybe look elsewhere.",15

"36","Apple iPhone 8 4.7"", 64 GB, GSM Unlocked, Space Gray","Great phone, but not worth the cash.","Owen Johnson","October 21, 2017",0,"Silver",3,"I'll say that this phone is like flying premium economy. Your seat is a little nicer, and you might get a drink or something. But you're still stuck in an airplane seat for a few hours and you spent quite a bit more money. For some of you, it's money well spent. But many of you won't think so.The hardware is really nice. It feels really good in your hand and it's a great size. The fingerprint sensor and the 3d touch feel very natural and comfortable. It does have a great camera that does low light well. The screen is very good, especially with the true tone feature that adapts to the lighting of your enviornment. However, I don't feel that all of the niceness adds up to the pricetag.There's no expandable storage. It requires a dongle to use headphones/line out. Call quality is only okay. Battery life is comparable to midrange android devices. The A11 processor is overkill and you pay a premium for it.  It comes with some earbuds that can only be used with the iPhone and are of okay quality. You can't charge the phone and use any other accessory without buying more dongles or aftermarket chargers. It comes with a wimpy 1A charger, which would be fine if phones that cost half as much didn't come with 3.2A chargers that can charge a huge battery in 20 minutes.I often subscribe to the idea that ""you get what you pay for"", but in this case, I really don't think you do. I think $700 demands more.",47

The new glass case is beautiful. I also like the display as it is crisper and the color is perfect on the screen. I purchased a gold phone for my wife and a silver phone for myself.This phone is fast. Don‚Äôt believe other comments you might see because I officially rate and run speed tests on my phones.  The gold phone, we purchased, is rated the fastest phone smart phone in the world at this time. It‚Äôs Antutu rating is 219575 and the second silver phone is rated at 216318.  This phone just blows away my iPhone 7 Plus with speed and downloading apps and animation quality. My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438. This speed is due to the new A11 Bionic chip with 64 bit architecture.This phone has the new bluetooth 5 which succeeds bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 is backward compatible to the previous versions. The new bluetooth has twice the speed of the 4.2 version and about 4 times the range. That is amazing since it uses less power and its message capacity is 255 bytes versus 31 bytes which makes the data payload of the 4.2 version rated at 20 bytes max. This is a major distance and data transmission increase in performance. I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone.The phone is designed to be IP67 for splash, water and dust resistant. The camera is still 12 MP but it has excellent performance with optical zoom and digital zoom up to 10 times. It also still has the portrait camera mode with the blurred background Bokeh effect by using both of the rear cameras. It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional.In the video recording mode I really like the 4K video recording with 30 or 60 fps.  Of course you still have the front facing camera with 7MP quality for face time or selfie photography. The slow motion mode is nice when shooting sports events or shooting wildlife videos.The phone is slightly larger but is still fits into most of your iPhone 7 Plus cases. The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.12 ounces versus 6.63 ounces.  The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.4 hours. The rating is 21 hours.The new phone is only available in 64 GIG or 256 GIG storage capacity.Overall this is a great phone. I am happy with our new phones and it is a good upgrade in power and performance.",19
"51","Apple iPhone 8 Plus 5.5"", 64 GB, Fully Unlocked, Gold","Best I‚Äôve Had!","Lovely Lasean","October 4, 2017",0,"Gold",4,"I love this phone! I upgraded from an iPhone 7. I would have to say this is one of the best iPhones I have ever had, and I upgrade every year. The camera is bomb.com. The portrait mode is pretty cool, and even the front facing camera seems to be more clear, (less grainy). The screen is brighter, the true tone display really makes a difference on the screen. This phone is way faster than my 7. The speakers are louder also. This phone has a lot of the same specs as the upcoming iPhone x, but still feels like an iPhone. I was going to get the x, but decided that I would wait until the next generation of that phone.  If you can get most of the same specs as iPhone x for less, combined with the familiarity and reliability of the iPhone we are used to, why not do that?",31
"52","Apple iPhone 8 Plus 5.5"", 64 GB, Fully Unlocked, Gold","Worth the upgrade from my 6Plus, but what were they thinking by taking away the headphone jack?","Erik Okerholm","October 16, 2017",0,"Gold",2,"Worth the upgrade from my 6Plus, but what were they thinking by taking away the headphone jack? You can't charge the phone and use your headphones at the same time, unless you use a wireless charging pad, which you can't use if you use those magnetic car phone holders (if you cover the spot).  The camera is better than my 6Plus, so is the battery. Love the extra Ram and processing power. Just don't understand the lunacy of getting rid of the headphone jack.I'm also not a fan of iOS11. The update added extra wording that eats into Messages, and other screen areas. You can't click on an address and have it map it like it did in the 6 and 6S.You can't have your phone plugged in the car to charge and use for directions and use headphones. You get to have everyone hear all the map updates or Waze announcements.There is no way I'd upgrade from 7 to an 8 unless you just wanted the extra GB of RAM and faster processor.Buyer beware....",31

"56","Apple iPhone 8 Plus 5.5"", 64 GB, Fully Unlocked, Gold","Some things were better and some were not","Lantana Al","October 31, 2017",0,"Gold",4,"I ""upgraded"" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not.While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5).UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more.TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees.Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their ""tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches"".iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) ""eye candy"" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder).iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say ""Hey Siri"" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated.So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads).I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates).Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH! And guaranteed 3 years of updates! These are BIG advantages of having Google phones. * So far the camera is impressing me. It's definitely better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera. I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16:9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget. UPDATE: I noticed a quirk in portrait mode processing that didn't apply the blur properly around someone's hair... hopefully that will be improved/fixed. * Can turn off animations - I like to do this to make the phone feel even faster: https://lifehacker.com/disable-animations-on-android-to-improve-performance-1583554900 * The phone seems very fast, even when it was installing a bunch of apps in the background. It's the fastest and smoothest phone I've ever used. * The sound form the front-firing stereo speakers is best I've heard from a mobile phone. * I wasn't too happy there was no headphone jack, but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter (which has a DAC in it) sounds better than my LG G5. I'll probably pick up an extra adapter or 2 (they are only $9 each) but are out of stock right now in the Google Store. Good audio video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pi_SykMCsI * The always on display looks great with OLED, and this is a really nice feature that you don't get on iPhone. * I like that you can change icon shapes (square, circle, ""squircle"", etc.). * I found out my mobile data wasn't working. After a few hours researching and messing with stuff, I ended up having to use a new Tracfone SIM and getting my service transferred to the new SIM. * The Pixel 2 has a 'Now Playing' feature that listens to any music that's playing nearby and tells you the name and artist (even on the always-on display), but I'm not sure how practical it is. By the way, it works without mobile data and WiFi and without sending audio to Google. UPDATE: I went to Target and my phone was identifying the background music Target was playing. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what a song is that was playing. * Fast charging is great (especially when you need it), and the Pixel 2 includes a beefy fast charger. * I really like that Google increased the warranty to 2 years. With the extra 24 months I get with my credit card, that gives me a 4 year warranty. Too bad it doesn't cover accidental damage though. * The Google Assistant is tops when it comes to brains (smarts), and can be activated with a squeeze or by saying 'hey Google' or 'OK Google'.Pixel 2 Android disappointments (could be rectified with Android updates): * No battery life indicator on the 'always on' display (my G5 had this and it was useful). * My LG lets you customize the navigation bar but the Pixel 2 doesn't without a little ""hacking"" it seems. I really liked that I could add an extra button to pull down the notifications. Maybe they will add this in Oreo 8.1. * There is a double-tap feature to check your phone but unfortunately you can't double tap it to turn the screen back off (my G5 had this too)... this one is kind of nitpicky though.",11
"57","Apple iPhone 8 Plus 5.5"", 64 GB, Fully Unlocked, Gold","If you don't want iPhone X but still want best iPhone then this is it.","A. Kim","November 3, 2017",0,"Gold",4,"Purchased this directly from Apple store.  Upgraded from iPhone 5s 64gb.  If you're Apple person, almost no learning curb.  Price though is stratospheric though cheaper than iPhone X.Unit is blazing fast compared to my old iPhone.  Screen is not OLED but still look wonderful with True Tone feature.  Lost use of some software because developers did not upgrade their software from 32-bit to 64-bit.  Speaker sound is much improved and really it is pleasure to listen while watching movie.  Even though optical zoom is only 2x, it is nice to have.  Digital zoom will go up to 10x but you pay in term of graininess.Guts are virtually same as iPhone X.  Probably the last of ""old-style"" iPhone and most perfect in term of integration of software and hardware.Will do wireless charging but you'll have to pony up xtra money for charger and stand.  Unfortunately, it will not fast charge like some Samsung android smart phone.Best to invest in good case and screen protector as unit has glass back (to facilitate wireless charging).",8

"64","Apple iPhone 8 Plus 5.5"", 64 GB, Fully Unlocked, Gold","It's okay but it's no Android","Lantana Al","October 31, 2017",0,"",4,"I ""upgraded"" from an LG G5 Android phone to an iPhone 8 Plus running iOS 11.0.3. Some things were better and some were not.While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5).UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more.TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees.Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their ""tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches"".iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) ""eye candy"" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder).iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say ""Hey Siri"" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated.So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads).I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates).Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH!
