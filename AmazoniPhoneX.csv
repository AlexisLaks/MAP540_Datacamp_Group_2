"1","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","Iphone X: A complete re-design and leap forward for Apple.","V12 Vantage","November 5, 2017",0,"Space Gray",5,"Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows:New screen (5.8” OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple)- Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus).- OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction.- Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.- The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc.Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID- Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X.- Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom.- I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it.- This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything.- This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background.Additional noteworthy features and changes:- The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions.- Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images.- Increased audio quality and volume- Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market.- Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design.- Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing.- In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone).Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation’s phones.If you have the money to spare you won’t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.Read less***Note Carrier Compatibility:All carrier variant iPhone X in the world are carrier unlocked.

"6","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","Great Screen, fast, maybe rushed but worth upgrading if you can budget it","Jamie Robertson","November 6, 2017",0,"Space Gray",5,"I am surprised to see such a high price on this phone. Not sure why people would over pay. My brothers and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6.The X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are.The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger.If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too.The Face ID works really well. Being brothers that look a lot alike we try to trick it but it doesn’t work. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.The 256g model can hold a lot of data which is nice and since your spending a grand you might as well spend the extra money and get the extra memoryPleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. In all fairness though, I could get by just fine with the iPhone 7 that I have been using. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you’ll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It’s a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don’t get dinged up.",41
"7","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","From a 6S to an X - A wonderful, luxury, phone","Taylor","November 9, 2017",0,"Silver",5,"This is a cross-post review from the unlocked version, but given they are the exact same phone, I thought it would be good to post:I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down to the bullet point list.The transition:NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to  a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).Face ID:I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode.It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).The price:There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there.What I love:- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store.- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening.- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.What I don't:Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",13
"8","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","WebOS reborn - the most beautiful, elegant, intuitive, user friendly, stable OS on the best hardware","Ibraar 'Le Saracen'","November 16, 2017",0,"Silver",5,"This is WebOS reborn and good riddance Home Button - after using this you won’t ever go back to such a clunky unintuitive way to do things again - WebOS was doing this in 2007 - with the X Apple has caught up at last and in doing so has left every other present (Android and iOS) offering left for dead.(Watch some YouTube videos of iPhone X and WebOS comparisons - remarkably similar - took Apple 10 years to catch up)I won’t much go over how gorgeous the hardware is - that’s evident.- I mean just look at it and handle it.I have the 64 GB silver - which is the most attractive version. The back of it glows - it’s beautiful to behold and wonderful to Handle and use - couple it with the Spigen Clear case - don’t hide the elegance and beauty - and those cases protect well using advanced materials for under £8. (In 5 years I’ve never damaged a phone when using the Spigen Clear).The screen is bigger than that of an iPhone Plus - but the handset is regular iPhone (6,7,8) sized - a tad bigger but hardly noticeable in the hand - and yes, unlike the iPhone Plus you can use this more or less one handed.The build quality is impeccable - it really is a premium device - the touch and feel - materials used - the screen pops at you (the ‘notch’ has the cameras and is a design feature which reminds me of the bite taken out of the Apple - it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed) and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers - so you can actually listen to music on it.(I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests?)Battery life is the best I’ve seen on a smartphone - a whole day of heavy use and by midnight I still had 40%.Reception and call quality again is as good as you can get.The hardware is gorgeous and coupled with the advanced internals you the have best handset on the market.But gorgeous hardware isn’t what makes a phone great - that’s the OS - and a modern OS should be user friendly, intuitive, beautiful to look at and a joy to use - it should also be fast and stable - so no annoying crashes or screen lock ups - this flies through every test and is a pleasure to use.Firstly Face ID - works more efficiently and more responsive than the finger sensor - works even in the dark and early morning with curtains shut and face screwed up - also effortlessly works with the browser, App Store purchases and other apps - and most apps have been updated to use this plus the gestures and screen of this iPhone X.The OS is a killer - the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic - leaving any half baked Android offering eating dust.iOS 11 on the iPhone X is WebOS 2017 - to think that Palm was so far ahead of its time - it built the most elegant and intuitive mobile phone OS back in the noughties - it’s give or take what the experience on the iPhone X is today.The iPhone X is beautiful to use intuitive gesture based card system more of less as was WebOS - switching apps? Swipe across the bottom - closing apps? Gently touch and Swipe a card up - switch apps? Swipe up and select the cards - and it multitasks properly - the camera and YouTube will run in card form (as on the WebOS TouchPad and Pre 3) - using every part of the screen to good effect - swipe from top right - from top or bottom reveals other features - and all fast responsive and with not a single crash or screen lock up in sight.I always hated the home button - coming from WebOS and HP Touchpad the iOS of the day was clunky and unintuitive - I noticed over the years how the iOS versions slowly morphed into what WebOS was - the morphing is complete with the dropping of the Hone Button and an adoption of an elegant intuitive card gesture based system which is a pleasure to use - the iPhone X is the best handset in the market and with the new iOS version it’s clearly the most beautiful intuitive elegant and user friendly - most stable and effortless OS on the market.A winner - thank you Apple and thank you Palm WebOS.",9
"9","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","Good phone but not impressively better","Amazon Customer","December 2, 2017",0,"Space Gray",3,"Just got my iPhone X yesterday as an upgrade to a still fully functional iPhone 6+. Is it a good phone? Certainly. Definitely in the top 5 out there. The point is, if you are like me, your phone is a utilitarian device. As such the iPhone X is really not a very impressive upgrade from the iPhone 6+. Is the screen better? Yes but so what? The 6+ screen was fine and the differences, as a practical matter, are not important. It is faster but the 6+ was more than fast enough. Better cameras. Sure. But who cares? The 6+ cameras were good enough. Aesthetics are better but, again, not earth shattering and not worth a premium upgrade. The UI changes are a PIA. Sure, you can learn them but I can’t say they are better - just different. Why fix something that was not broken. Battery life is not substantially different. All in all, was it worth the upgrade? Not really. This is not saying the iPhone X is not a good phone. It is but it as a practical matter, the functionality of the improvement is marginal at best. I think Apple has run out of ideas or this product category is now so mature that there is little useful innovation left to squeeze out. What would be impressive and ground breaking? Radically improved radio performance or battery life. That would make for a marked improvement in utility.",16
"10","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","Welcome to the future with the iPhone X","Thomas King","January 1, 2018",1,"Silver",5,"This is a great phone with an amazing camera.  The facial recognition really blew me away.  And the case is thin enough that it can charge on a charging mat (not provided) if that's your fancy.  Plenty of memory and I just inserted a SIM card from my ""pay as you go"" provider and now I enjoy all the features and benefits without the expensive cell phone contracts that others use.  I will advise you that this phone sells for approximately $1,150 in retail stores everywhere, so don't be taken in by sellers asking $1,300 or more.If you intend use this for a non-contract provider, you may have to enter the APN information from your provider in order for the phone to have full functionality (such as sending photos with text messages).  Also, not all pay as you go providers guarantee the phone will work with their service, so be sure to find out before you make the phone purchase.",1

"12","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","Rate the phone not the price","Omar","November 8, 2017",0,"Space Gray",4,"I think people need to comprehend if they are reviewing the price OR THE PEFORMANCE OF THE PHONE.  You can’t give a crappy review because you don’t like the price.As for me I’m pretty much bleh towards the phone.  Have had it almost a week and I guess it was worth 1000.  If it disappeared tomorrow and I had to go back to my 6s plus, don’t think I would bat an eye.  But I cannot say that it is full of bugs and issues.  Does take some getting used to on no home button but have not had any problems with mine.  Would also suggest the lifeproof next case.  Otterbox was junk in terms of how the side buttons would respond.  Lifeproof slam doesn’t cover the charging port and really doesn’t have much water repelleing properties (yes I know the X aready has water resistant properties).  Life proof next covers all ports and really works greatwith the side buttons.  Plus clear back shows the exterior of the phone nicely.",9

"15","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","Phone of the year!!","Marcus Jackson","November 9, 2017",0,"Silver",5,"iPhone X review: This is me telling what it has been like with the iPhone X the past six days of me using the device.Feel of device: Great feel to the device , the glass back makes the device less slippery but also trades off for more fingerprints. The glass back makes it heavier then the iPhone 7 but I like that because it’s feels more premium to the hand.Battery: The battery has but ok for the phone size , in a heavy user can I can get 10 hours out of the device with 5 sot. So I would it’s good battery life but it could be better if apple give us a bigger battery. Light user will get through a full day with no problem.Screen : What can I say this screen is the best one to touch an iPhone yet! I lover the way everything just pops at you with this display . It’s on par with the Note 8 screen if not better from my personal believe. This screen is longer then the one on the 7 plus but it is not as wide as that screen and I like that but many people do not! It feels better in my hand with the more narrow screen.Speakers: They are very loud compared to my iPhone 7 Plus big upgrade. I keep them around 70% volume. It’s very clear and crisp ! They ear speaker at the top is about loud as the bottom fire speaker now  ! That’s no exaggeration  neither.No Touch ID: I forget about it completely but I did see myself reaching for it the first two days of use.Face ID: I’m loving it so far! It was a learning curve though you can’t put it to close or to far away from your face. I found the elbow length away from your face is the perfect position. It does work in complete darkness I tested this while and a closet a night time lol.Cameras: if you had the iPhone 7 like me the iPhone X cameras are a slight improvement with quality, The stabilization is what has improved greatly ! Everybody that has shakey hands recording I’m glad to say the iPhone X is your cure. Portrait mode is great when it works ! You have to have perfectly lighting and also have to be close to the phone for it to work I hate that . When you do it get to work the results are amazing to say the least.The notch: Your eyes will naturally start to ignore it if it’s not even there.Overall experience: I’m liking this device and enjoying everything about , the multitasking is better now because you can just switch through apps from a left swipe from bottom of screen, One thing that is keeping me from recommending this phone is the price tag. No phone should cost $1,000 and I urge anyone only to buy this phone if you can get it at a discount and if you can get it at a bargain I would tell everybody to try the iPhone X out for a go!!",8

The camera is better than most new phone cameras (4K), Face ID works great for me, the all glass design is fragile, but a good case can protect it from a fall.

"32","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","No Stars for the iPhone X........ buyer beware........","FrankMD","December 7, 2017",0,"Space Gray",1,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6+ to the X at full price through AT&T. It took nearly 6 weeks to receive. It is significantly small than the iPhone 6 plus by size. The actual screen dimensions is about the same. Yes, the color is somewhat brighter but the clarity and brightness is not (even with adjustments). Simple to set up and outside of no home button (swipe up), it is essentially the same layout. I would agree with other reviewers, it is no faster than the older model. The camera does produce a nicer photo but is this device worth $1300 for a better camera? I do not think so. You could purchase an even nicer camera for less. Facial recognition is fair to good but far from perfect. I ended up switching to digital security since I use the phone for work. I need as close to absolute security as possible. Speaker sound is better in volume and clarity. As you go from screen to screen (different applications), you can literally feel the phone shake like one use to feel hard drives activate in older laptops. I do not know what is up with this since in all my previous iPhones I never felt any mechanical movement from the phone itself. Everything works appropriately but this brief vibration is more annoying to me than the absence of the home button and being able to turn the phone off my pressing one button instead of two. Bad workmanship to engineering. Bottom line: if you do not absolutely have to upgrade your phone or you are not receiving the phone free (AT&T is giving a free iPhone 8 with an added line), then I would wait for the next generation. A larger phone is anticipated with the ""X"" features but I must admit I find the ""X"" is under-featured when it comes to being a pivotal new generation of iPhones. The iPhone X is anything but pivotal, ground breaking (outside of dropping it, it will indeed break) or full of new useful features you do not already have on your current iPhone. Even if I had to upgrade I would go with the iPhone 8 plus over the ""X"" since you keep the home button and larger size is nice for jacket pocket and those with bigger hands. To say I am disappointed in the iPhone X is an understatement. I have monitors which are more impressive than this phone's screen and cost a third of this phone. In my world, I have already abandoned the Apple laptops and iMacs for my workplace and home for similar unimpressive advancements in technology. I am now going to do the same with my phones as well. Will try Samsung and other models for the future. Apple is loosing their magic touch since the loss of Steve Jobs. Some individuals do indeed make a company great. I have little doubt Jobs would have been very unhappy with this iPhone and would never have released it but made the company wait 6-12 months to have something truly better than the status quo. Otherwise it is my conviction this model was put out to make money and all of us fools who fell for this are now truly paying the price. This is a turning point for me with Apple. I am done with their products. I am done with iTunes (music). ""Alexa, never order any more Apple products for me! And please play current hits and call my office.""",14

"36","Apple iPhone X, GSM Unlocked 5.8"", 256 GB - Space Gray","First impressions after a week of use","Armen","November 26, 2017",0,"Space Gray",4,"Unlike the iPhone 8 Plus, here the camera module has sharp edges and is positioned vertically.When the device is on the table, on the back, it actually always lies on the camera module and if you press the housing, it starts walking on a flat surface. The dimensions of the device are such that it is wide and quite noticeably cuts into the hand. The back panel is made of tempered glass, as well as the front panel covering the screen with oleophobic coating, but the marks from the hands are clearly visible. The glass panel behind is needed for wireless charging. On the left side there is a lever, which includes a noiseless mode, below - two volume keys. On the right side, the on / off button (in fact, it's now unlocking and calling Siri), just below - the tray for the nanoSIM card. At the bottom of the right is the speaker, the second speaker is on the front panel above the screen. They work in pairs, and the volume of the sound is different, for this parameter iPhone X can give odds to many flagships, and I like it in this aspect. The microphone is on the bottom end, and also at the camera block behind. At the top end, the microphone was not placed. The noise reduction system works medium, in noisy conditions your interlocutor hears strange sounds. Places for the percentage of battery power on the display just do not.In iPhone X, the battery charge is very quickly consumed during voice calls, which is not typical for such devices.Unlike a fingerprint, you can register only one person. No way to share the phone with biometrics, only a password that can be passed on to someone.In practice, face recognition is quickly adjusted.When driving the iPhone X, the phone holder will have to be strongly shifted to the left to the handlebar, and also tilt it towards the face, otherwise no recognition occurs.I really like how the device records video (especially 4K at a rate of 60 frames per second), but this video can only be viewed on the device itself, since a new compression format is used, when transmitting all video is converted. In the maximum resolution mode, the sound is written to one microphone.In iPhone X changed the interface and it will take a little time to get used to the lack of the ""Home"" key.",1

I love how there's no home button, which I thought would annoy me. Unfortunately, its not at all stable. My first iPhone X completely died from 40% battery charge. I left it plugged in for the whole day to a working charger & it still wouldn't turn on. I went to an Apple Store, and they replaced it. The second iPhone X worked very well until tonight. Now, it will not open any links in Safari. Both iPhones have refused to unlock with a passcode...sometimes crashing as many as 6 times in a row before unlocking.

The top part of the screen seems like such a waste. It looks cool, but still. I was hoping to have a solid contender to the Pixel 2 XL that Google sent me to beta test, but it didn't seem to match up. The display itself on the iPhone X is beautiful. The colors are a bit better than the Pixel 2 XL's, but not enough to look past the other shortcomings. The camera on the iPhone X is really cool, but for the type of photos I like to take, the Pixel 2 XL's camera wins.If I still had my iPhone 8, I would definitely prefer it over the iPhone X.I think Apple went a little too high on the cost at first and didn't properly delegate their time on the other aspects of the device that were also important.I know Apple will quickly fix the bugs and weird quirks the iPhone X has now, but it would've been nice to feel like the money was well spent when I received it.I'll update my review in a month.",10

If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction.The transition:NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to  a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand).Face ID:I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode.It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook).The price:There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there.What I love:- The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black).- The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it.- The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store.- I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth.- Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way.- The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera.- The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening.- The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.What I don't:Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",48
"74","Apple iPhone X, Fully Unlocked 5.8"", 64 GB - Silver","Iphone X: A complete re-design and leap forward for Apple.","V12 Vantage","November 6, 2017",0,"Space Gray",5,"Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically.First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X.The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows:New screen (5.8” OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple)- Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus).- OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction.- Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly.- The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc.Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID- Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X.- Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom.- I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it.- This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything.- This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background.Additional noteworthy features and changes:- The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions.- Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images.- Increased audio quality and volume- Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market.- Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design.- Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing.- In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone).Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation’s phones.If you have the money to spare you won’t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.",45

It is not the unlocked one, but as someone who was hesitant to make the switch, I wanted to write a review.  I never get the latest and greatest technology.  I always waited and go the ""s"" version of the new iPhone.  But the pull of longer battery life and a larger screen in a normal size phone overcame my concern of price, a few negative reviews, and to be honest, the stigma of having the most expensive iPhone ever.  I am so glad I did.  This phone is amazing.Highlights:  Great battery life.  On my old iPhone, a 6s, I could get about 4 hours of moderate use before I had to charge, maybe 2 hours of heavy use.  I went all day with moderate to heavy use and used less than 50% of my battery.  The screen is as beautiful as all the people say.  I have found many of my apps have already been updated to take advantage of the screen.  The new gestures are very intuitive and in less than 12 hours I was completely used to them.  Facial recognition is fast and I haven't had a single issue.  I am terrible at taking pictures and this phone makes me look like I know what I am doing.  Though there are a lot of setting options, they are really easy to navigate through.  They say this is the bestsmartphone ever, and I have to agree.Negatives:  Because this is so expensive, you might be a little overprotective.  And you should be.  But on my wireless plan, it only increased my payment about $8 month.  I don't find that to really be a negative.  I haven't found anything I don't like about this phone yet.This is a truly awesome phone.",3

I can say that of all the iphones, the x is my biggest disappointment. I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc.  This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off.  I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue.  Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues.  Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects???  It's more than that.  I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy.  The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan.  The face recognition is awful.  I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern.  If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off.  A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it.  These are all legit concerns.  Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done.  I am truly disappointed.  I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine.

"80","Apple iPhone X, Fully Unlocked 5.8"", 64 GB - Silver","Worth the upgrade","Jamie Robertson","November 6, 2017",0,"Space Gray",5,"My brothers and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6.The X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are.The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger.If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too.The Face ID works really well. Being brothers that look a lot alike we try to trick it but it doesn’t work. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.The 256g model can hold a lot of data which is nice and since your spending a grand you might as well spend the extra money and get the extra memoryPleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. In all fairness though, I could get by just fine with the iPhone 7 that I have been using. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you’ll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It’s a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don’t get dinged up.",15

"86","Apple iPhone X, Fully Unlocked 5.8"", 64 GB - Silver","iPhone X Defect","Jason Grady","November 11, 2017",0,"Space Gray",1,"My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I don’t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I’ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn’t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it’s a Saturday and he’s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn’t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that’s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it’s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I’ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I’ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I’ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I’d have to say I’m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple. Hopefully all is redeemed on the 14th. To be continued...",43

He called us tonight but the speakerphone quality was horrible. He could hear us fine but it sounded like he was underwater (it was too difficult to understand him so we hung up early). I am quite sure it was not a signal issue as we speak with him every Sunday from his apartment with good signal (AT&T). My advice is to take your time ordering in case it is a hardware defect that cannot be solved by a software update. Hopefully it is the latter given what I paid for it.",15
