Moi qui chargeait mon ancien iPhone tous les jours meme au départ. Inégalable chez les autres marques de téléphone portable.

48,5," Super satisfait du passage de l’iPhone 7 basique au 8 Plus. Le choix du blanc évite les traces de doigts sur le dos en verre. La prise en main est un peu plus sûre même si le téléphone reste assez imposant à une main surtout en cas d’ecriture. La fonction portrait de l’appareil photo est juste super sympa et la vidéo 4K est assez agréable. Sinon rien a redire, plus qu’a Tester la charge sans fil, pour le reste, cela reste du Apple.

83,5," Répond aux attentes, produit parfait mais bon ne change pas trop de mon ancien iPhone 6  Avis complet  "
84,5," -- Les plus -- La qualité iPhone : ça reste du haut de gamme donc difficile d'être déçu si on est habitué à iOS. Selon les habitudes entre Android ou iOS, chacun pourra se faire son avis. Cet iPhone 8 Plus possède l'écran le plus confortable de la gamme (excepté pour l'iPhone X qui possède la même surface). Qualité photo exceptionnel grâce au double objectif -- Les moins -- Néanmoins ça taille reste assez imposante en main : difficile de parcourir l'ensemble de l'écran à une seule main. L'appareil est assez lourd par rapport aux précédents (peut être dû au verre de chaque côté) La prise jack est toujours manquante... le dongle lightning->jack semble toujours assez fragile au niveau du câble si on utilise un autres casque filaire que le casque appel fourni. L'utilisation d'un casque ou d'écouteurs bluetooth semble quand même la meilleure utilisation  Avis complet  "

116,5, J’ai un peu peur que le 8 plus ne passe pas dans la poche de pantalon mais en fait ça le fait bien même assis. L’écran est exceptionnel et on se fait très vite à sa taille.  Avis complet  
117,5," Conforme à ce qu’on attend d’un iPhone : fluide, élégant, intuitif. Les photos sont magnifiques ainsi que la vidéo dont la qualité est bluffante. Le mode portrait reste à perfectionner car certains résultats sont vraiment décevants quand toutes les conditions d’éclairage ne sont pas réunies. A priori autonomie d’une journée avec un usage relativement intensif. Très content de ce produit dont la qualité justifie (presque) le prix. Prévoir le budget protection en conséquence, verre d’écran et coque car l’ensembke Est de toute évidence fragile.  Avis complet  "
118,4," Téléphone « classique » d’Apple. J’avais un 6s et je me sentais à l’étroit surtout pour lire en mode portrait et pour jouer. J’ai hésité avec le X, mais outre son prix prohibitif, il ne répondait pas à mes besoins à savoir, un écran plus large. Le X à beau avoir une diagonale plus importante il n’est pas aussi large que ce 8 Plus. De plus le ratio de ce 8 Plus est pour moi tout simplement idéal (16/9). En plus je n’aimaisnpas Du tout cette encoche en haut de l’ecran du X qui gêne en lecture vidéo et en jeux. Ceci étant dit voici pour moi les points forts et faibles de ce téléphone. Points forts : + La taille et le format de l’écran idéal pour lire en mode portrait et jouer. Autre bénéfice le clavier virtuelle est bien plus confortable à l’usage que sur un 6s ou les rouches sont plus petites. Du coup presque plus de faite de frappe! On tape beaucoup plus vite. + La puissance du processeur A11 Bionic absolument incroyable. Aucun ralentissement. Tout se fait très vite, même avec les apps les plus gourmandes en ressources. + la qualité des photos et le mode portrait qui fait de superbes clichés. + La qualité de la dalle LCD. Un vrai plaisir de regarder son écran. Les vidéos sont vraiment ultra plaisantes à visionner. + Bouton home haptique, super rapide et plus confortable à l’usage que l’ancien. Un vrai confort à l’usage. + la réalité augmentée. + la recharge sans fil (pas encore utilisée) + le dos en verre est magnifique (dommage on doit le cacher par un étui) Points faibles : - L’encombrement du téléphone en rapport à la taille de l’écran. C’est LE gros point faible qui avec le poid font perdre une étoile à mon évaluation. On atteint les limites du confort. Les bordures sont importantes pour un téléphone haut de gamme vendu à ce prix. Apple exagère vraiment sur ce point. Mais quand on est fan d’IOS (j’ai testé Android et je n’aime pas du tout), on a pas le choix faut faire avec ce que propose Apple. - Le poid, plus de 200gr, une fois qu’on rajoute un étui ça commence à peser. J’avoue que je me sers plus de mes écouteurs Bluetooth. C’est un poid faible que je relativise beaucoup car je passe peu d’appel. Et pour jouer ou utiliser les apps ce points n’est pas gênant du tout. Si c’est 2 points faibles sont acceptables pour vous, foncez !  Avis complet  "

129,3," Par contre il n’a rien de plus que l’iphone 6+, au contraire il a moins, il n’y a plus la sortie pour écouteurs et quand on est entrain de le charger on se trouve comme un abruti on ne peut pas utiliser les écouteurs. Je trouve que c’est une décadence de la part d’Apple. Aussi le poids est un inconvénient il est plus lourd que le 6+ pour moins d’utilités.  Avis complet  "

Le ratio d'écran est meilleur et le bouton Home avec Touch ID est à mon sens bien plus ergonomique que Face ID. Et puis le côté ""massif"" de ce téléphone me plait. Les performances sont bluffantes, c'est un monstre et je n'ai constaté aucun ralentissement même en utilisation intensive. L'écran avec True Tone est tout simplement magnifique et reposant. L'appareil photo est d'excellente facture et donne des clichés superbes en toutes circonstances..... bref je ne suis absolument pas déçu de mon choix, même si comme toujours apple fait payer cher ses iphone....

264,5," Ce téléphone est idéal en stockage et pour la qualité d'image. Avec du recul le 7 plus à la date de mon achat à un meilleur rapport qualité prix. (-140e) Dans mon cas, je change de téléphone rarement (durée moyenne Iphone 4 ans), je me suis fait donc plaisir sans regarder le prix. Par contre j'apprécie la fluidité du processeur et l'IOS 11 ultra compatible. Le double caméra est clairement un ""plus"" par rapport à la version Iphone 8. Si vous chercher à acheter les protections c'est les même que l'Iphone 7 plus (pas le 6 plus/caméra selfie différente)  Avis complet  "

Ceci dit, si vous êtes sur un 6, 6s, 7, le changement peut valoir le coup (comme dans mon cas) si vous souhaitez un plus gros écran. Il remplace mon 7 que j’adore toujours parce qu’il est petit, sobre et passe partout mais j’ai toujours voulu avoir le «Plus » pour le coté phablette. Le choix qui s’offre ensuite à vous entre le 7 plus et le 8 plus dépend du budget. Les coques vont aussi bien à l’un qu’à l’autre. C’est pour vous dire du peu de changement qu’il y a.

301,5, My whole family has only used iPhones since they started coming out. Wouldn’t use anything else  Avis complet  
302,5," Since Apple decided to bypass the regular ""s"" models of their phones in favor of a new number, the iPhone 8 Plus is basically what the iPhone 7s Plus would have been. An upgrade to the hardware, but the same external size and components. Either way, the iPhone 8 Plus is a great phone and is faster than the 7 Plus and boasts the best battery of the iPhone lineup!  Avis complet  "
303,4, If you really can’t get past the X not having a home button the 8 builds on the current design of the iPhone that has been around since the 6 was released. Wireless charging is finally here for the iPhone.  Avis complet

306,5, Went with the I Phone 8 instead of the 10 because that's what my daughter wanted. She loves it!  Avis complet  
307,5," I replaced my iPhone 6s Plus with an iPhone 8 Plus. The battery in my 6s Plus was deteriorating & rather than replace the battery I decided to upgrade to an 8 Plus. The battery lasts much longer & I really like the processor speed & the wireless charger capability. Also, I was able to get a pretty decent trade-in value for my 6s Plus.  Avis complet  "

322,5, Like the new 8. Kinda the same as my 7 but works better.  Avis complet  
323,4," I almost love this phone. It's is extremely responsive, and much faster than the 6s I had. The battery life for me (not a heavy user), is quite nice, lasting at least 36 hours before recharging. My only complaint is that it is wider than I expected, and I can no longer text with one hand, even with the split keyboard.  Avis complet  "
324,5," Decided not to wait for battery replacement on my iPhone 6 and just upgrade to the 8. It's basically the same phone with a better camera and force touch, plus all the other new bells and whistles. I debated on getting the X but wasn't that impressed with face id and I'd have missed the home button too much. My first iPhone was the 4 and lasted me until the 6 came out and now I got the 8, which is better longevity than any of the android phones we've had. Battery lasts super long now which is great, camera is nice, the gold is pretty. New (to me) home button takes some getting used to, specifically that touch id so so super fast now that it takes me to my home screen when I really just wanted to quick check my notifications on my lock screen or swipe to take a photo. I need to get used to just picking it up and tilting it instead.  Avis complet  "
325,5," this is my first foray into the PLUS size iPhone. at first I thought it would be bulky. but no, it fits well in my pockets and the screen is awesome!!!!  Avis complet  "
326,5," love the new iphone, great phone, awesome camera. Love it  Avis complet  "
327,5," I love my I-phone 8 plus. It is big enough to see, but not too big to hols. Pictures are great. It was not a hard adjustment from my 6. It did take a second to get use to the button pressure. I also added an app that tkes me to the home page.  Avis complet  "
328,5, Phone is great but it sucks Apple makes you buy a new phone every 2 years  Avis complet  
329,5, My wife loves this phone but we are disappointed with Apple making u buy a phone every 2 years  Avis complet  
330,4," Phone has everything I need, making the X an unnecessary waste of extra money. Get the 8 plus  Avis complet  "
331,4," Phone purchase suggested by our son, who has used iPhones for years. Learning transition from years of android use. Not finding degree symbol on keypad.  Avis complet  "

339,5, Love the IPhone 8 Plus. I have always owned Apple products. Love the quality and ease of use.  Avis complet  
340,5," Auch wenn viele Experten behaupten, dass es wenige bis keinen Unterschied zum 7 plus gibt, muss ich dies dementieren. Die Kamera, die Geschwindigkeit und die Displayhelligkeit sind viel besser. Die Kamera macht super schöne Bilder...man braucht keine Extrakamera mehr. Der Prozessor arbeitet rasend schnell und der Akkuverbrauch ist geringer als beim Vorgänger. Die Glasrückseite sieht total edel aus ... vor allem in Gold ... hat einen leichten Hang zum Roségold und das sieht richtig schön aus. Ich bin vom 8 plus überzeugter als von der X-Variante!!!  Avis complet  "
341,5," I came from a 5 so it’s a big step up a lot faster and more features. I don’t think the reception is any better for calls. I set it up with iCloud and was easy. If you have Apple Music make sure you have playlists turned on in the library home screen. That setting didn’t seem to transfer from backup. Verizon was a pain, I had to call 800 automated line to activate. The information was right online but just would not take.  Avis complet  "
342,5," My daughter's iPhone 5S began having numerous problems, therefore, I had to upgrade. Best Buy had a better deal on the iPhone 8 which overall will save me money. I had planned to get her the iPhone 7 but for a few dollars more we were able to get 256GB which is best for my daughter! Audrey and Karl were AWESOME knowing I had limited time, they worked as a team and had me in and out with time to spare!

346,4," I bought this phone to replace my mom's old laggy iPhone 6+. She likes it and she easily learned all the new features quickly. Thank you Best Buy for setting up her new phone for her before she left the store. My mom is having a minor issue with her new phone. When she is in a low signal area or overly congested area, call quality sounds terrible on the person she called side.The call comes in clear on her end, but on the other end the call quality is very muffled, staticky, and has an echoing effect. I don't know if this a Apple issue or Verizon issue. According to her, Its only happened a few times over a course of a month. Besides that issue, she likes the phone a lot over her old iPhone.  Avis complet  "
347,5," The iPhone X gets all the love (justifiably so) but this is is a great upgrade from previous models Fast great screen and camera, great speakers and battery life. Powerhouse  Avis complet  "
348,4," I upgraded from the iPhone 6s and there really isn’t much new to this one. It has the wireless charging capability, which is cool, but everything else is essentially the same. That’s not a bad thing since the 6s was very good but there aren’t really enough improvements to make it worth the upgrade u less you are having issues with your current phone and need something new. It’s a great phone though.  Avis complet  "

355,4, He had a android before. He likes this better easier to operate  Avis complet  
356,5," Das iPhone 8 Plus für mich das beste iPhone auf dem Markt. Ich hänge schon lange an Apple angefangen hat es mit dem iPhone 2G dann 4 ,5c,6,6s mit meinem iPhone 6s war ich super zufrieden nur langsam hat die Batterie nachgelassen und es wurde langsamer. Ich wusste nicht was ich machen und konnte mich nicht entscheiden welches mein neues iPhone werden soll. Ich ging in den Media Markt nach Karlsruhe und lies mich beraten von einem sehr kompetenten Mitarbeiter. Am Anfang hatte ich Zweifel ob das iPhone 8 Plus mir nicht zu groß sei doch dann entschied ich mich doch dafür und es war die beste Entscheidung meines Lebens.

I've upgraded to an iphone 6 and now finally the iphone 8 plus. It does everything and more.

431,5," I knew it was due time I upgraded my 6, so when I started doing research, everything kept drawing me to the 8.

435,4," I upgraded from 6s Plus to the 8 Plus, and I’m very pleased! Apps don’t glitch, the camera functionality is superior, battery life is WAY better, and it seems to run more smoothly. The only irritation I have is that my mail app, every couple weeks, will act like it’s reloading all of my emails from scratch like it would the first time you set it up, which uses a ton of internet bandwidth and slows the phone a bit. Other than that, the phone is great and I’m very pleased with my choice!!  Avis complet  "

450,5," It’s an Apple product, what more is there to say???  Avis complet  "
451,5," I bought the IPhone 8 Plus and thought about returning it for Samsung Note Or IPhone X. Glad I kept the 8. I like that it’s familiar with some newer twists. The texting is better( not so many unwanted words being sent) and it’s much faster. Camera is really nice. I had to turn off Siri because it was always popping up when I pressed the home button. All in all, I’ll hang with Apple for a while and see how they improve the X.  Avis complet  "

491,4, Love every aspect of this phone except there is no music jack output. Other than it rocks  Avis complet  
492,3, I considered switching to Galaxy but decided to give Apple another try. No big wow with this upgrade from my 6s. I am not totally in love. Just feels like I am in a bland relationship with no changes. I will say the camera is much better but that is about all. Will likely switch to Samsung on my next round.  Avis complet  
493,4," As an Apple freak, the iPhone 8 was the logical choice. Chose the 8 Plus due to having large hands. It works. Some cool features.  Avis complet  "

499,5," Have been a Samsung Galaxy owner since the S4. Good phones, I never made the change due to freedom etc. what made me change was reliability.

504,5, Best phone on the market. The camera is amazing. Not to mention the staff was very helpful.  Avis complet  
505,4," The phone functions just fine. It’s fast (of course, it’s new) and the perfect size. The only thing they seemed to be able to brag about was the glass back for wireless charging...which is nice but adds to the fragility of this phone. Not much else is new! I upgraded from a 6.

506,4, nice product odd to handle at first......................  Avis complet

508,1, I purchased this iPhone as a Christmas gift for my grandson (age 22). He has a photography hobby and owns many cameras. He is delighted by the quality of photographs taken with the iPhone 8 plus. On the day of the purchase I learned of the AT&T promotion offering two phones for the price of one. I took advantage of the promotion and have upgraded my phone from a 6 plus to an 8 plus.  Avis complet

513,3, So far the iPhone 8 Plus is doing good. It has been working good  Avis complet  
514,3," So my daughter's iphone 5c was aging, being nearly 4 years old, and my iPhone 6 stopped working correctly, and I'm watching the lawsuit against Apple with glee. I wanted to go Samsung, but she loves apple, so I took one for the team, fully charged my ""6"" so it would work when evaluated for trade in, and got this phone as the 'buy one' part of the special AT&T was running under their Next program. Of course, my '6' was a 64Gb, and was nearly full after 3 1/2 years, so I sort of talked myself into getting the 256Gb beast. Apple could simplify all of our lives (theirs and ours) by just providing a slot for a standard memory expansion card (micro SD?) like other makers do for Android phones. Would make transferring or printing photos ever so much less sucky. BB staff was decent to work with, although some of the conversations between team members about disciplinary discussions were kind of unprofessional. Keep that stuff in the break room please.  Avis complet  "
515,5," I'm so glad I went to Best Buy to buy our iPhones! The service was amazing and we are so happy with the selection they had, even right after the 8's were released!  Avis complet  "
516,5, This was a replacement for an iPhone 6s that our son likes but he hasn't really changed what he does and it used 10 gigabytes of data in the first month. Before he was using about 4 gigabytes of data. We will take it to a Verizon store to see if they can help us fix it  Avis complet  
517,4," Due to ""battery"" conspiracy with Apple, I upgraded to the iPhone 8 Plus rather than the iPhone X. There have been too many problems with the X, and it is not the size of the Plus devices, so I will have to hold out until next year. HOWEVER, THIS PHONE IS NOT THAT BAD AT ALL!  Avis complet  "
518,5," I have had each plus since the 6, I wouldn’t have upgraded so soon but my 7 started acting up and so I jumped the gun and just upgraded. Well instead of the Best Buy members just looking to see if they could help me with my old phone they just jumped on the sale of course and come to find out I just needed to upgrade to the new update on my 7. So now I feel like I have two of the same exact phones. Cannot tell any difference between the two.  Avis complet  "
519,5, I love the size of the screen and the resolution. : )  Avis complet  
520,5, I purchased the 8 because I wanted to have a faster phone and more gb. I am very happy with this purchase. Can't go wrong with Apple.  Avis complet

535,5," Die Bestellung und die Lieferung über Check24 war vorbildlich. Just in time Lieferung. Das Gerät ist ziemlich groß und wuchtig. Gegenüber dem normalen 8 ist nicht viel anders, ausserdem Bildschirm. Zum surfen und Videos gucken ist es super, aber ob der preisliche Mehraufwand gerechtfertigt ist, ist grenzlagig. Aber aussehen tut es. Nur der Preis ist leider hoch.  Avis complet  "

564,5, Best Buy had daily door buster deals and this was one of the last ones. Saved a $100 on a 256gb ip8. Can’t go wrong. My wife’s loved it and she will never run out of space for the baby pics. Keep up the deals Best Buy!  Avis complet  
565,5," I love my new IPhone 8! I upgraded from a 6s. The camera is fantastic and the processing speed is very good too. I received the phone in the mail, activated it and mailed my old one back. Very easy!!  Avis complet  "

571,5, So far this phone has been great. Especially the camera and video which i use a lot  Avis complet  
572,5, My old phone was a 5s thus the improvements are striking. Much to learn but initial use of the camera is very impressive  Avis complet  
573,5," We were initially very skeptical about the size of the 8+, as we upgraded from the 5! However, we love it!!! We also are really enjoying The extra storage and the absence of the “not storage” pop up!! Love the upgraded camera/photo options. Amazing!  Avis complet  "
574,5, Although it took sometime to get working just with plan changes and activation this is a great phone.  Avis complet  
575,5, at first my wife thought this would be too large - wouldn’t fit in hands or pockets and be too hard to adjust to. after a few weeks it’s hard to imagine what we were using before. we BOTH got one of these. she really likes the white color. i went with black. so far so great.  Avis complet  
576,5, iphone is the standard for me. i’ve had just about every incarnation.. keep coming back b/c they just always work. never had a bad one. the X is way overpriced. hope they work that situation out.  Avis complet  
577,5," My son loves this phone and says it has a really nice camera. Once you go to the larger phones, you never go back.  Avis complet  "
578,5, Always love the iphones. Takes a little getting used to but I wouldn’t get anything else  Avis complet

580,5," Fast,great camera and everything that the iPhone do.  Avis complet  "
581,5, For the price and memory it’s a great product. Camera is great too  Avis complet  
582,5, Wife's iPhone 6 would not work even after changing battery. Time for an upgrade. Huge leap in storage and features for her. She loves it so far.  Avis complet  
583,5," I was convinced last year I would buy the new iPhone X when it was released. All the leaked photos, specs, etc., made it my clear choice of my new upgrade. Then I went into Best Buy and actually held the X. First impressions: it's small. But this is because I have always used the plus sized phones when possible. Screen looked great. However, when I pulled up some videos and did a side-by-side comparison with the 8s Plus, I knew I wanted the 8. The screens look identical with great resolutions. Colors are bright and vivid, even ""crisp"" if that is word that can be used to describe colors. But, despite the fact that the X screen is just slightly larger than the 8s Plus, the videos were smaller. Much smaller. This is because of the screen ratio being slightly less wide than the 8s Plus. For me, this alone was the deal breaker. I can do without the talking emojis. That would get old for me real quick. I like seeing my screen big and bright. The X is bright, big, but not when it comes to videos, Netflix, etc. That's really the only drawback. Oh, and my 8s Plus was $200 less. Sold.  Avis complet  "
584,5," The iPhone 8 has practically all the features of the iPhone X but at a much lower cost. Good size, easy to handle, and Apple quality.  Avis complet  "
585,4," Love this iPhone, I’ve had apple products since the very first Mac book and iPhone and I recommend Apple every time. Their product may be priciest compared to “ Microsoft “ but I’ve owned both types in laptop and phone version and Apple products have always been virus free maintenance free and trouble free for me, I have never had issues with Apple!!  Avis complet  "
586,5, This is my first smart phone. I chose a IPhone because it is set up just like my iPad. Love the size of the plus. Looked at the reviews for the different iPhones and decided on the 8 Plus. I liked the 8 Plus better than the X.  Avis complet  
587,5, I went from the Galaxy S6 Edge plus to the 8 plus and I absolutely love it! What a super sleek phone! Everyone should have it!  Avis complet  
588,4, I upgraded from the iPhone 6 and I guess I expected a little more. The battery life does seem to be a lot better though.  Avis complet  
589,3, My last 6s was perfectly fine until all of a sudden my battery started acting weird. So I got the new phone instead of a battery.  Avis complet  
590,5, I upgraded from an iPhone 6. The iPhone 8 is much faster & I like the convenience of wireless charging.  Avis complet  
591,5, If you are a fan of the iphone than this one is what you are looking for. If you have a older one consider replacing the battery if you don't want to spend money on a new phone.  Avis complet

593,5, My son loves his new phone!! He didn't have any problems setting up his phone or using his phone.  Avis complet  
594,4, Not much different than my iphone 7. I upgrade every year but not ready for the X. I like having a home button. Wish I had gotten the gold instead. Home button is hard to see in dim light.  Avis complet  
595,5, It was hard switching from Samsung to Apple a year ago but I am hooked now.  Avis complet  
596,4, I don’t find much different between the iPhone 7+ and the 8+. However I do love the camera. I’m very happy that it fits my accessories of the iPhone 7+  Avis complet  
597,5, We love the new camera feature that it offers. Quality of phone is great.  Avis complet  
598,5, Huge change from the 6s to 8. My daughter is very pleased with it  Avis complet  
599,5," I really don’t see a big difference with any of the other IPhones, it’s ok  Avis complet  "
600,5, This phone was less what we wanted to do and more what we had to do after a catastrophic iphone 7 plus disaster. My wife says that this phone is much better and that she loves it. What more could I ask for?  Avis complet  
601,5, I brought this as a gift to my daughter. She loves everything about the phone from the size to the upgrade. This phone is better than the 7 & X  Avis complet  
602,5, Apple 8 is so much faster than my 6. Does everything I need and more.  Avis complet  
603,5, Love the new phone. Always love apple products and this phone is living up to the Apple standards so far  Avis complet  
604,5, Very happy that I stuck with the apple product too  Avis complet  
605,4," When I finally resolved to upgrade from my iPhone 5S, the decision came down to the 8, 8+, or X. I went with the 8 because I preferred the more compact size, and didn't feel like the extra $300 justified the facial recognition, better camera, etc. that the iPhone X offers. I went with 64G because I don't store a lot of content (music, videos, etc.) on my phone; I keep most of my content library in iCloud and download as needed. So far, I'm really liking this phone, but there has been one issue: poor cellular reception in my house, which has also been a problem for my wife with her iPhone 6. This was never an issue with my 5S but there have been multiple occasions with the iPhone 8 where people have had difficulty hearing me (although I could hear them fine). It could be a Verizon issue or it could be a phone issue, I'm not sure. Will try to post an update once I have more info.  Avis complet  "

610,5, i loved it very practical and up to date device i think its wonderful and as a deal its a good one  Avis complet  
611,5," Switched from a 5S - love the larger screen. Be sure to have your data transferred - next time I’ll have a pro do it. No texts transferred over & I lost a couple of notes, but the quality is outstanding! (Slight learning curve, but worth every second!!)  Avis complet  "
612,5, My husband finally decided that he wanted a smartphone. He's really enjoying learning lots of things that this phone is able to do!  Avis complet

633,5, The iPhone 8 replaced an iPhone 5. Not into replacing whenever a newer model comes out. iPhone X was more than I really needed. The look and feel of the new iPhone is perfect.  Avis complet  
634,5, The best iPhone to date. I recently traveled to New Orleans and didn’t need a professional camera to take awesome pictures. Using the internet and taking pictures did not drain the battery. Apple finally got it right!  Avis complet

644,4, Just the same old iPhone. Just with better spec than last gen.  Avis complet  
645,5," This is my 4th IPhone, started out with a 4s and wow does that seem antique now. I upgraded from a 6s plus to this one and really wasn't expecting a big change. I can tell that this one is much faster and like the new camera features. I was bummed after upgrading my 6s to IOS 11 because there were many times it locked up and a few of my apps didn't work well. I think apple needs to do more testing on older phones before throwing out a new os to everyone. I really like the wireless charging also. I was afraid I wouldn't charge through my Otter Box defender case but sat it down on my charge pad and away it went. I bought the Belkin power up charge mat and it works great, faster than using the oem cable. So far I really like my 8+, was gonna go with the X but figured I do that one ( or what ever the new model is by then) next time.  Avis complet  "
646,5, Best option of the current available iPhones. Liked the fact that it still has the home button.  Avis complet

656,4," Upgraded from a iPhone 6s Plus. Got this instead of the 8 because I liked the bigger phone. But since my iOS updated before I got the new phone, I don’t really notice anything that would be worth upgrading from a 6 to an 8.  Avis complet  "

726,4," Got this phone for my father-in-law to upgrade this old iPhone. I am knocking one star out because my father-in-law gets unwanted notification reminders about setting up apple pay since he doesn't want it. I had to enable it but not include any cards to avoid the annoying notifications. I do like the zoom feature which makes everything bigger, which is great for older adults.  Avis complet  "
727,5," I love all the features and ease of use of the iphone 8 plus. It is a little large for my purposes to use when running and working out, I prefer the size of the iphone 8. However, my daughter loves the size of the 8 plus to watch nextflix. Great screen.  Avis complet  "
728,5," Tolles Produkt, absolut empfehlenswert! Wie immer ein Top-Produkt, wie von Apple gewohnt.  Avis complet  "
729,5," Das IPhone 8 Plus ist ein echter Hingucker! Es ist optisch super hochwertig und glänzt von der besten Seite. Das Display auf der Frontseite ist sehr gut auflösend und man erkennt keinerlei Bildfehler oder Pixel. Das Glas auf der Rückseite macht das IPhone noch edler als seine Vorgänger mit der Aluminium Rückseite. Die Antennenstreifen fallen somit weg und es sieht nicht mehr so aus wie ein Prototyp, wie noch beim IPhone 6. Durch die Glasrückseite ist auch Induktives Laden möglich. Einfach Smartphone auf eine Induktive Ladestation legen und IPhone lädt zwar langsamer als mit dem Lighting Anschluss aber es ist extrem praktisch. Hier kann jedes mögliche Chargingpad benutzt werden, weil Iphone den G-Standart eingebaut hat die die Ladestationen alle drin haben. Das Betriebssystem ist übersichtlich und leicht zu bedienen. Mit dem neuen IOS 11 kann man das Menüfeld, das geöffnet wird wenn man vom unterem Bildschirmrand nach oben wischt, individuell gestaltet angepasst werden. Mit 3D-Touch kann man länger und fester auf die App Icons drücken und es werden Schnellfunktionen angezeigt. Eine Neuerung ist die Taschenlampe wo man mit 3D-Toch warmes oder kälteres Licht einstellen kann. Oder ganz neu im Menüfeld, der Aufnahmemodus. Mit dem Aufnahmemodus wird dein Display als Video aufgezeichnet. So braucht man keine weitere App dafür. Die Kamera schießt gestochen scharfe Bilder. Die Kamera ist wirklich atemberaubend gut. Dadurch das das Plus modell 2 Kameras hat, ist der neue Porträtmodus möglich, der einem ermöglicht den Hintergrund scharf und dafür den Vordergrund scharf zu stellen und Fotots wie mit einer teueren Digitalkamera machen zu können. Viele sagen der Akku sei nicht so gut, aber man kommt locker durch einen Tag mit einer Akkuaufladung. Der Akku ist kleiner als beim Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge zum Beispiel aber der Akku des 8 Plus ist besser hergestellt worden, mit neuer Technik. Durch den neuen Bionic A11 Prozessor ist das IPhone 8 Plus das Smartphone mit dem schnellsten und stärksten Prozessor zur zeit auf dem Markt. In ANTUTU Benchmark erreicht der Single - und Multi - Core mehr als 10.000 Punkte. Zum Vergleich: Ein Samsung Galaxy S8 erreicht nur 6.500 Punkte. Der Prozessor ist zukunftssicher und ultra schnell. Deswegen macht es so Spaß das Gerät zu benutzen, weil es unglaublich schnell und keine Ruckler oder Aussetzer hat. Viele beschweren sich wegen dem nicht vorhandenen Klinkenanstecker für Kopfhörer. Man muss die Kopfhörer per mitgeliefertem Adapter oder mit dem mitgelieferten Kopfhörern mit Lightning-Anschluss anschließen um Musik hören zu können. Allerdings kann man dann nicht gleichzeitig laden. Ein Ausweg wären Bluetooth Kopfhörer damit man beides gleichzeitig machen kann. Aber in Alltag stört es nicht, denn man schafft den Tag locker mit einer Aufladung und so kann man die Kopfhörer dann anschließen. Zusammenfassend kann man sagen, dass das IPhone 8 Plus eines der perfektesten Smartphones auf dem weltweiten Smartphonemarkt ist. Es hat viele Vorteile aber auch einige Nachteile wie der Preis zum Beispiel, wo ich gar nicht näher drauf eingegangen bin. Ich empfehle den Kauf eines IPhone 8 Plus.  Avis complet  "

733,4," Not what you expect, if you have a 7 going to the 8 is not a big jump  Avis complet  "
734,5," My wife loves this device. Her only complaint was adjusting to the large size. She loves everything about it - speed of processing, ease of use, and size of storage (256G). I’ve made a monster and now she’s always going to want a “phablet”. I ordered this for self install and had no problem setting it up at home.  Avis complet  "
735,5, My daughter’s first choice! Very pleased with that choice.  Avis complet  
736,5," I was nervous about the larger screen, but in the end... I love it!!  Avis complet  "
737,4, I am upgrading from an iPhone 6. Awesome and powerful phone.  Avis complet  
738,5, I’ve owned many iPhones and the 8 still works as well as others. The volume on it doesn’t seem as loud as previous models but everything else is what you would expect in iPhone series.  Avis complet

742,5, Love the Phone. Great Apple Product. B Easy to set up and transfer all the data and history from my previous Iphine.  Avis complet  
743,4, It a good product. Apple is now the top of my price point. Looked at the iPhone X. Just wasn’t worth the extra $$$. I went for 8plus instead. Dont see myself going beyond its price for a phone.  Avis complet  
744,5, geil einfach nur geil dieses handy macht sooo schönee bilderr ihr müsst euch das kaufen  Avis complet  
745,5," Super schnell, und im Shop war alles unkompliziert, gerne wieder. Es läuft alles über die Media Markt App wie Benachrichtigungen, der Abholschein direkt von der App vorzeigen, fertig, kein unötiger papierkram.  Avis complet  "
746,5, Upgraded from my iPhone 6 Plus. Love all the new features and especially the clear picture and awesome pictures it takes.  Avis complet

750,5, The IPhone 8 Plus is a really great phone and I love the camera  Avis complet  
751,5, SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY OLD 5S PHONE WHICH WAS IN NEED OF A NEW BATTERY. GLAD I MADE THE LEAP.  Avis complet  
752,5, Purchased this during the holidays with that BOGO promotion. It's a nice upgrade to my current 6S. Really like the fast response and (Finally!) better camera quality. The glass color in the back is nicer than the previous versions too  Avis complet  
753,4," Great phone! It is a major upgrade from my 6s, but I think I could of gotten more on the trade in.  Avis complet  "
754,5," I jumped and bought the iPhone X but returned it. I then got the iPhone 8 Plus and have no regrets. I compared the two and the only differences are the size, screen resolution and Face ID vs Fingerprint. All other features are identical.  Avis complet  "
755,5, bought 2 of them for my kids. The screen is so big I am jealous.  Avis complet  
756,4," I have recent experience using both the iPhone SE and iPhone 6s Plus. The Plus model was too big since I use a case with a belt clip to carry the phone, and the SE's screen was a bit too small. I am going to compare my review of the iPhone 8 (purchased unlocked at full price and used with Verizon prepaid) mostly to the iPhone 6s Plus, but one has to understand that the SE especially at prepaid price is an excellent, outstanding phone too with almost all of the same features as the Plus!) Pros: The iPhone 8 is an upgrade in a few ways. Apple includes a compare feature on its website so I won't go into all of the details, but I will try to address the ones that are upgrades to the iPhone 6s Plus. True Tone display does make the screen easier to read because the lighting isn't as harsh. This is coming from someone who has vision problems and prefers the ""daylight"" bulbs because I need good lighting to see. This phone features water resistance, which means one can now uses cases that might provide better protection or do not muffle sound. With that said, I use a Ghostek Nautical 2 case also sold through BestBuy. It provides great protection combined with waterproofing. Since I use hearing aids to stream audio, sound being muffled isn't an issue and people can hear me clearly. The camera specs *seem* to be similar, but I can see a difference! The pictures are clearer, sharper, and more detailed. Also, this smaller model has the optical image stabilization for the video too. To get the best quality video, I shoot in 4K even though the final output will be in 1080p. Larger files won't take up as much room on this model thanks to upgraded compression features. This model includes an improved flash too. The sound quality on the iPhone 8 seems to be louder and clearer. There is a front speaker too. With my previous phones I also used battery cases. The iPhone 8 with the same use seems to get me through the whole day, but I plan to buy an external battery charger that will also allow me to charge wirelessly soon. Neutral: The bluetooth is supposed to be an upgrade. I am not sure if this is a hardware of software issue with iOS 11 through 11.2.1. At the time of this writing, I am having some issues with it. With phone calls, my made for iPhone hearing aids do not work as well. Sometimes only one connects. Other times I notice a periodic static or crackling sound. Areas for Improvement: What I do not like about the IPhone 8 is the glass back because of how it is designed. In my opinion, it is a very poor design choice, and what weighted the most heavily on my decision to knock star off the overall rating. It is almost half of the cost of the phone without insurance to replace this! The iPhone 4s has a glass back too. However, one could remove two screws and slide off the back, which means the back plate and battery were easily replaced. A fast charging wall adapter was not included in this premium priced phone. I use a Belkin (also sold through BestBuy) or iPad one instead of the one included with great results. Without a case, the ""gold"" looks like rose gold around the edges and several shades lighter on the back. It looks expensive and stylish, but this look disappears with a case. I miss my Rose Gold that could be seen even through a clear back case. Comments: I didn't wait for the iPhone X. I think the technology behind the facial recognition features is impressive. However, without Touch ID too, I am willing to wait to see how this works out and will decide again when I upgrade next time. I would prefer the bigger iPhone screen on a smaller size. The built-in portrait features are a plus, but I can do most of that with software. These three differences were not worth the price difference to me. Overall Conclusion: I am enjoying using my IPhone 8 with improves on previous models, and it was the best overall choice for me.  Avis complet  "
757,1," It's an apple product, what more can I day, I'm a Samsung guy, bought this junk for my wife cause that's what she wanted for Christmas  Avis complet  "
758,5," I have to wonder what may be the point of writing a review on a phone. The tribal mentality that is Android vs. iPhone has obfuscated any real discussion around fitting the right tool to function. Subjectively, and objectively as one can muster, it is redundant to say this is a beautiful functional top shelf device. The only thing I can offer to anyone on the fence is consider whether you are someone that ""needs"" your device... needs your phone to meld into the million parts of the daily kaleidoscope of your life, to find it's place in your own personal flurry.... or if you are someone that is buying the phone primarily as a daily fidget spinner of sorts; a electronic time killer to insulate the space between the minutes. To keep the walls warm between seasons. Neither of those are ill things, nor does one always find themselves only in summer flurries or wedded to the cruel mistress of hurry up and wait. Do you need your device, or does your device need you? The iPhone 8 is a stalwart servant to your court. Android is a small child, a forever needy fledgling. The rest is what you're made of.  Avis complet  "
759,5, This iPhone 8 has some really amazing features to it that I haven't even started to tap into. I'm sure if you want to bump up to this phone you too will totally satisfied with all the new updates and features.(FYI:Just remember the more new upgraded iPhones Apple puts out...your older iPhone will start to function incorrectly more and more) it's there way of getting you in to buy a newer iPhone.

760,4, Great phone. The designated mute button is a waste  Avis complet

798,5," Coming from a standard iPhone, switching to this iPhone 8 Plus took some research, but, it is a huge improvement. The screen takes some getting used to, but bottom line, if you text or use the keyboard often, I recommend the larger version of any phone. I love Apple!  Avis complet  "
799,2," I usually get excited about new iPhones. Bought a 8 Plus and a X. The 8 Plus seems like the same ole same ole. Maybe I’m getting spoiled, its just not worth the money to me  Avis complet  "
800,5, Have had an iPhone for many years so it was an easy decision to get another newer one! They are so easy to use and have so many great features!!  Avis complet  
801,5," I have always had android phones, and in fact had just upgraded to the Samsung galaxy s8+, but decided to return it and give the iPhone 8+a try. There is a bit of a learning curve involved, but now that I have figured things out I love this phone and am glad I made the switch.

809,5," Again I'm an android fan and my wife isn't so upon her inspection, she raves about this phone.  Avis complet  "
810,5," My old iPhone 6s was doing fine till I absolutely obliterated it. The reviews of the 8 were good enough so I went with 8 vs the 10 and saved a small amount of $$. Surprisingly the reviews of the 10 were less than desirable - another reason to pick the 8. It has performed flawlessly so far and is quite a lot like my old 6s, just a little faster. Good phone, recommended  Avis complet  "
811,4," This is a great phone, pricey but worth it. Great camera quality and storage.  Avis complet  "
812,5," This is a product that is soooooo user friendly, that after using it my wife bought one as well.  Avis complet  "
813,5," Devices are getting more advanced each iteration and this phone is no different. I am a tech teacher so I enjoy the ""figure"" out part of this device. My hand size is small, but I need the bigger screen to view information on my phone without hurting my eyes. So far I like the phone and this is my third iPhone.  Avis complet  "
814,5, I like the larger screen on the 8+. Didn't see much additional value in the X  Avis complet  
815,5, Great iPhone for the storage and price. Would definitely recommend.  Avis complet

818,3," Not much has really changed from the 6S to this, other than Apple won't start slowing this one down for a few years [hopefully]  Avis complet  "
819,5, I have always been an Apple product fan and this purchase supported that.  Avis complet  
820,5," Does everything I need it to do. Takes amazing pictures, is fast, etc. Great upgrade from the iPhone 6.  Avis complet  "

825,5, This feature on the phone a better look; easy to operate the bar;  Avis complet  
826,3, So far works as advertised. Battery life is good. Phone is a bit big. Don't like how apple forced me to switch charger types  Avis complet  
827,5," Finally upgraded from my 6plus, was going to do the 10, but stuck with this one and glad I did. Phone has a great camera!  Avis complet  "
828,5," Sound quality is much improved, stereo speakers, and now plays longer sound files for messages and such. Upgraded to this from an iPhone 4s that was five years old and still had original battery in it. Plan to get at least another five years out of this phone.  Avis complet  "
829,5," HIgh speed coenctivity, and excellent pictures, no more professional camera needed  Avis complet  "
830,5, Great screen to phone ratio! The weight as feel of the feel in your hand is on point.  Avis complet

836,4," 8 plus is large- almost too large, close to being a tablet on your ear.  Avis complet  "
837,4, Still subtle in color when placed in a protective case.  Avis complet  
838,5, Love the size of it so easy to see and as always Apple is the best  Avis complet  
839,4," the 8 is an extension of all other iphones similar in function, this is a large phone takes a bit to get used to  Avis complet  "
840,4, definitely recommend. nice upgrade from the 6s plus  Avis complet  
841,5, Daughter loves it. Awesome camera and fast internet.  Avis complet  
842,5," I found that my old iPhone wasn't keeping up to what I was used to so when Verizon came out with a rebate, I took advantage.  Avis complet  "

844,5," Large screen, easily handled, fast, once you go apple you can’t go back  Avis complet  "
845,5, This phone is better than I expected. The speakers are good and the camera quality and zoom are great.  Avis complet  
846,5," Best Buy reps did a great job to upgrade my cellphone, transfer data and complete the transaction in a timely manner  Avis complet  "
847,5," I was torn between the 8+ and the 10. Ultimately I decided on the 8+, and am really happy with what it has to offer. The pictures are fantastic- clear as day. Great phone!  Avis complet  "
848,5, Love love this phone!!! I would tell everyone about it  Avis complet  
849,4, It’s an iPhone. It’s not much different than my last iPhone except it runs the latest iOS without having to worry about Apple’s intentional slow-down yet. I like the Plus- my last phone was standard size and I really love the larger screen. But it’s heavy. Sometimes the phone stops responding to touch screen for no apparent reason. This is concerning. And I may bring it up with Apple Support after a little google research. Overall - it’s really OK. It’s a good phone but probably not much better than any other good smart phone.  Avis complet  
850,5, The camera is much better and my area of TX can get dusty quite often so I will really enjoy the dust resistance.  Avis complet  
851,5, Another great phone from Apple. It feels a little lighter and I enjoy the larger screen of the Plus.  Avis complet  
852,5, Got this on the buy one get one promotion with AT&T. My wife loves it.  Avis complet

857,5, Ich bin mit dem Artikel sehr zufrieden. Gutes Preis und Leistungsverhältnis. Ich würde dieses Produkt meinen Freunden weiter empfehlen.  Avis complet  
858,5," Hatte vorher ein IPhone 6 und bin auf das 8 Plus umgestiegen. es ist jeden Cent wert. Das Design ist top, die Größe und die Auflösung *_*  Avis complet  "
859,5, Love how easy it is to get a new phone at Best Buy. Walk in tell them what I want and walk out with my phone all set to use. Love the service and how much knowledge the workers have about the phone plans and phones.  Avis complet  
860,4, I have had an iPhone 5 for years and it was time to upgrade. This phone works well and updates some of the problems I had with the 5. The 5 was a great device for the time but was not a great phone. Sound quality was poor. The 8 sounds much better.  Avis complet  
861,5, Phone is a nice upgrade without the large pricetag  Avis complet  
862,5, The portrait setting on the camera for the iPhone 8 Plus takes wonderful pictures. Very pleased so far  Avis complet

864,5," Great phone, love the new features. Love the color  Avis complet  "
865,5," Easy to operate, easy to read, very happy! Going from a Galaxy S6 to the iPhone 8 Plus was a great decision for my husband. It's a good size phone especially in the otter box for his big hands and the print is large enough to see without his glasses. He's been transformed to an ""i"" guy!  Avis complet  "
866,5, Great iPhone with lots of memory. The fastest iPhone so far.  Avis complet  
867,5, Great upgrade love the camera and the speed for the internet  Avis complet

869,4, This classic iPhone is great for the price Great camera  Avis complet  
870,5," I wasn't sure that I wanted to upgrade to a new phone, but I actually like the iPhone 8. The only thing that I’m not sure about is having to use an adapter for headphones.  Avis complet  "
871,5, I like my new iPhone it runs much quicker than my iPhone 6  Avis complet  
872,4," Can be slow at times, should be fixed with next update  Avis complet  "

875,5, It’s a IPhone not much to say. Great phone easy to use.  Avis complet  
876,5, Loving my new iPhone. It's been many years of using androids and I always thought they were the best - but after having this for just a couple months I am SO glad to have made the switch. Usability is intuitive and camera quality is amazing - especially in portrait mode. The Apple wallet is convenient. Love this purchase.  Avis complet  
877,5," Enjoying the larger sized Plus, many useful features and a great camera!  Avis complet  "
878,5," I love my new phone. I upgraded from the 6 to the 8 plus . I was afraid of the size , but now I LOVE it!  Avis complet  "
879,5, This iPhone 8 is by far the best iPhone I have owned. Plus the wireless charging is an amazing convenience with super quick charge ups.  Avis complet  
880,5, I purchase this for my mom.. bestbuy had amazing deal got the phone free great camera and very fast  Avis complet  
881,5," Love my new iphone8. Perfect size to fit into my old case that I love, OS11 works great with it. And service by Best Buy made my purchase easy and quick  Avis complet  "
882,5, I went from the Iphone 6 to this and it is amazing how much bigger the screen is. I look at my old phone now and can't believe how small it is!  Avis complet  
883,5, I love the Apple phone and I had a great experience with the beat buy staff!  Avis complet  
884,4, This phone has the best camera quality ever! I love it it!  Avis complet  
885,4, It’s an iPhone just like the last ones and the coming ones nothing real special  Avis complet  
886,5," I've always been a fan of Apple products, and the new Iphone 8 is no exception. It has a great camera. The battery life is fantastic (unless you are FaceTiming which drains the battery faster). I thought I wouldn't like the no headphone jack gimmick, but nowadays most headphones are wireless anyways or you can use the headphone jack adapter, which really isn't as burdensome as I thought.  Avis complet  "
887,5," Purchased iPhone 8+. I had the iPhone 5 before this. I know way past it’s prime but still functional. Very happy with the 8+ so far. Can see the screen much better, clearer pictures, easier to hear others talking, faster processing even with the videos and battery life is so much better. Took some time to get fingerprint log in to work. Had to delete and repeat a few times. Now with it working I do like it. It’s better than having to enter an eight digit pass code every time. Only had a four digit pass code on iPhone 5. Have the otter box defender as the case. Thought it might be too bulky but works just fine for me.  Avis complet  "
888,5, Great camera and really fast. So many upgraded features from the iPhone 6 I had. Bought the whole family one.  Avis complet  
889,5," We love our IPhones, this was for my son. He loves it no issues.  Avis complet  "
890,4," The IPhone 8 is a good phone. The small size and more GB than my I6s was an attraction to purchase. The phone is very similar to the I6s, except there are two speakers making the sound quality better when using the “loudspeaker”. The camera is supposed to be better, but I can’t tell the difference between that and the I6s. I wish it had a portrait photo mode that automatically blurs the background. Androids have portrait mode.  Avis complet  "
891,5," I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it! I wish that Apple would not have gotten rid of the 128gb option, but it is what it is.  Avis complet  "
892,5, I purchased this for my eldest son. He loves it but wish he had gotten the plus.  Avis complet  
893,5," Ich habe meinen treuen Begleiter - ein iPhone 6 Plus nach 3 Jahren durch das iPhone 8 Plus ersetzt. Das Gerät begeistert mich seit dem ersten Tag. Die Geschwindigkeit, die Qualität der Kamera und die Möglichkeit induktiv zu laden sind unschlagbar. Das iPhone 8 Plus 3GB RAM im Vergleich zu 1GB RAM beim 6 Plus. Daraus resultiert eine völlig ruckelfreie Bedienung von vielen Apps, die im Hintergrund laufen, ohne vom Betriebssystem iOS beendet zu werden. Ich liebe es ;-)  Avis complet  "

902,5, I am a loyal iPhone user and this upgrade came as a necessity when my screen cracked and I was eligible for an upgrade anyway (although my wife thinks I did it on purpose). No complaints on this model. I was not sure if I wanted to wait for the X at that time but I am happy with the 8 Plus - the bigger screen was the best thing since I came from a 6 with the smaller screen.  Avis complet  
903,5, Love that I did not have a huge change in size of phone. Nice updates from the 6s . Enjoying figuring all the bells and whistles out.  Avis complet

913,5, Works great. Happy with my purchase. Got it in space grey.  Avis complet  
914,3," This is the first iPhone I have ever owned. I am normally an android user but I needed a new phone and there was nothing android out that was interesting to me. Pros of the IPhone 8 -the sound is pretty good -the standby time for the battery feels like forever -I really like the fingerprint scanner -Other than the average white front, the glass finish on the back is actually quite luxurious Cons -The battery seems to drain quick when in use -You have to buy all those extra pieces for fast charging -No back button and menu area on the touchscreen like the android -You can’t customize anything other than basic contributions All in all. The IPhone 8 is pretty alright. I’ll probably honestly go back to android unless Apple owes me with the IPhone X 2  Avis complet  "
915,5," The 21 year old female loves it! What else can you expect out of Apple? As for me, it's too large.  Avis complet  "

926,4, I got this phone for my wife. Its the iPhone 8... what else do i have to say. The specs have been virtually the same for the last 3 iPhones. So there is nothing really special about this one. Its nice and sleek like most Apple products. Best Buy had $100 so I decided it was the best deal at the time. But the box came unsealed so I took off one star for that!  Avis complet
