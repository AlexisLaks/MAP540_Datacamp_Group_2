0,5,The case is light and the color coordinates with the phone.
1,4,"I've owned four galaxy phones prior to getting the S8, and I hated all of them. Each one had some pro's but there were always a couple of deal-breaking cons. It just so happened that when my LG V20 died suddenly, the Galaxy S8 got a really big discount from Samsung so it ended up being so cheap that I couldn't pass it up. I crossed my fingers and hoped that maybe they finally got this one right. The screen is spectacular. Seriously, best screen I've ever seen on a phone. Better than the iPhone, better than the LG V series, better than the Pixel and Pixel 2. The camera, well it's hard to describe just how good it is. I'm a former professional photographer and rarely leave home without an SLR or mirror-less camera but I find myself not reaching for them as often now that I have the S8. My expensive cameras still get plenty of use, but the S8 has taken some absolutely stunning shots. It's also wicked fast, had pretty good battery life, reliable fingerprint reader and the often omitted notification LED on the front. So why not 5 stars? I've got one major gripe and that's the fact that the phone is made entirely of glass. The front glass wraps around the sides and the back is also glass. It might look good but, it is a fingerprint magnet, it's slippery and hard to hold, and I'm always terrified to drop it. I went through a half dozen cases before finding one I really like and actually trust (Spigen Neo Hybrid). If you prefer to carry your phone without a case, be warned that this thing is F-R-A-G-I-L-E."
2,5,My daughter really enjoys this galaxy 8 phone and its features.
3,5,"I was really lucky to cash in on the deal for a new unlocked Galaxy S8 which also came with a $100 gift card and wireless charging pad. My phone company couldn't match this deal, so I am very happy!"
4,5,"I have had iphones before, but since I switched to Samsung I have enjoyed using my phone a lot more. It's incredible what Samsung has to offer in this Galaxy S8. I would totally recommend people to get it."
5,5,Bought it from US as it is substantially cheaper than India. Love the features and battery life.
6,4,I switched from Iphone back to Android and it was a very seamless switch over using the included cable adapter. Overall I enjoy the functionality of the phone and the ease of integrating it into my daily needs.
7,5,This phone is easy to use and very fast! Love my new phone!
8,5,"Bought this for my wife on xmas. She is extremely happy with the phone. Fast, lots of storage (64gb) and long battery life"
9,5,After having an IPHONE before this I was nervous that my Samsung Galaxy would be hard to get used to but I had no problems at all.
10,4,wow big up grade from Samsung g 4 lots to learn or relearn on this new samsung g8 phone
11,5,"I thought my Note 3 was great, but as it aged, it began to drop calls if I wasn't on 1st floor. My new Samsung S-8 has performed excellently. It's easier to handle, the camera is great, and I haven't had to leave the basement family room to have clear communication with friends and family. The sales person was great and the Samsung rep was there and patiently explained to my wife and I, how to use the aspects of the phone that was new to us."
12,5,"I love the phone so far. i love the ease of transferring music from my laptop unlike the Iphone. I also looove the private folder option, i literally have a whole new world in my private folder (apps, gallery,..) anything i don't want anyone going through my phone to see. In all Great Phone!"
13,3,"I purchased two new Samsung S8 phones for holidays to replace my 2 year old Samsung S6 models. Unfortunately, the performance (on Sprint or Wifi) isn't that much better than my 2 yr old S6 models. Battery life even with Power Saver set is less than 8 hours."
14,5,Kept my Gal S5 until got this S8. Wonderful phones!!
15,5,This phone is much better than the iPhone 7 I upgraded from and in my opinion a strong contender to rival the IPhone X with half the price. The display is clear and crisp and actually very usable for a phone this size. Perfect blend of form and function! Battery life is also better than other Galaxy's I have had in the past.
16,5,"Was a windows phone fan, but since they totally mismanaged / promoted them and left us high and dry, had to move on. The S8 Had exceeded expectations! Lots of ways to customize it to act like a WP. Everything on this phone works great. Made switching to android easy."
17,5,"Beautiful pictures, so compact, fits right into my pocket, very vivid screen, great for viewing movies and shows"
18,4,"Been using this phone for a few months now, generally happy with the performance and battery life. For the most part you don't need to worry about it lasting through the day, though keeping a fast charger around is a good idea. When charging it charges VERY fast, which is a major plus. Software wise, I'm happy with the ""always on display"" while I turn most every other Samsung feature off, including the annoyingly-named ""bixby"". One stupid thing is if you choose to use the Google assistant instead of the evil ""bixby"", you won't be able to say ""Ok google"" when the screen is off. Hopefully Samsung allows this at some point in the future."
19,3,It took allot to get use to this phone.. the setup is different and hanging up after phone conversations can be difficult.
20,5,"Good phone with good price and unlocked, no commitments for 24 or 30 months"
21,5,"I upgraded from an S5 to the S8 and have loved it from the start. Great screen quality, fast speeds, and awesome camera! Battery life is much better on this phone as well."
22,5,Really love it - way better than my I-Phone. Definitely will be the way to go in the future.
23,5,So far so good. Love my new phone and the way it fits so well in my palm. Gorgeous display and amazing speed.
24,4,I would give it a 5 stars but it doesn't have wifi calling and video calling
25,5,"Love this phone, love Samsung products. Easy to use."
26,5,Would recommend to anyone one even considering leaving Apple for good
27,5,"What a great phone. Clear screen, lots of memory and easy to use. Personal Assistant Bixby is easy to use and has a pleasant female voice. My SIM card from Galaxy S4 wouldn't fit in the new phone. I went to Verizon and they installed a new SIM for free."
28,5,The design is sleek and amazing. My girlfriend loved the new phone.
29,5,I'm always hesitant to upgrade my phone. Newer doesn't always mean better. But this S8 is fantastic. Same great feel as before with better technology.
30,5,Wow! This phone is amazing I cannot believe it'll take me this long to buy a new phone!
31,5,Purchase phone and had issues with dropping calls. Returned and got a different phone and new phone works great
32,5,The Samsung Phones are better than the iphones. I don't know why people waste money on iphones.
33,5,Still discovering all this phone has to offer but I'm thrilled with the camera features. Great sound as well.
34,5,This android device is hands down the best offered.
35,5,I love the speedn of the S8. The camera and picture quality is very clear. There is a lot of storage for people like me who likes to take a lot of pictures.
36,5,"This phone has an amazing screen, great features and decent battery life!"
37,5,This is a great upgrade from my previous phone. At $300 off is was an unbelievable value.
38,5,I have had this phone for over a year with no issues. Highly recommend.
39,5,The phone is great. Camera works great. Battery life is excellent.
40,5,My daughter likes her phone. It has all the features he was looking for.
41,5,Awesome phone. just got it and cant beleive how nice it is.
42,4,"I love Samsung phones. I don't use the fingerprint reader due to new location, and have hit the bixby button several times accidentally, but battery life is great as well as picture quality."
43,5,Purchased shortly after debut. Has all the bells and whistles. Happy overall.
44,4,Got the phone for Christmas as a gift for myself. The only thing I don't like about it is the battery is not removable.
45,5,It has been rock solid and the touchscreen works great!
46,4,"Phone works as it should, very similar to the s6 I would have liked to see some more noticeable upgrades. Everything works great and phone is quick. Only thing I’m not keen on is the curved edges, it’s much like the edge phones which limits case options."
47,5,"I love my Samsung. Superior Product , I have always brought I Phones. I am so glad I switched to Android,"
48,2,Small size makes texting difficult as the keys are too small. Not have a home button makes it difficult to know which end is up. No noticeable improvement over the S7 and in some ways worse.
49,4,So I am an Apply user but this phone is great. The only thing I do not like is the still buggy android operating system. One day they will fix it. This phone is flawless.
50,5,"I'd had a Samsung Note 3 and wanted the Note 8, but price was a deterrant. I was thrilled to take advantage of a Black Friday half price sale. The Samsung 8 has met all my expectations and more. I enjoy how fast it is, it gets better reception than my old phone, has many features I haven't even explored yet."
51,5,Before I was a Avid HTC cell phone user. I would always get the latest model the latest updates and features. But after purchasing my Sam song galaxy eight: I don’t think I would ever call back or use another cell phone brand. It has all the features that anyone would want and it’s easy to use but less thinking of the process
52,5,"Love the camera, it takes really clear pictures. Perfect size. Great starter phone for teen"
53,5,"I bought this for my firend , she liked it alot . Thanks best buy :)"
54,5,"Instructions were clear & easy to follow. Set up was just as easy. All my photos, contacts, and downloaded apps were moved over to the new phone. Couldn't be happier!"
55,5,I upgrades my 6 edge to this and I love it. Very durable too
56,5,The phone is great love alll the features. Battery is good goes all day at normal use.
57,5,This phone does everything and more. The screen size is perfect for my everyday life.
58,5,Thought about switching to Apple this year and glad I didn't. To me the S8 is nearly the perfect phone. Only gripe is the fingerprint sensor location.
59,5,"Great phone, great for multi-tasking. Love the ease of use as well."
60,5,Love this phone works really well great size and I like the edge on both sides
61,5,Great camera. Really nice biometric security. Very comfortable in my hand.
62,5,An excellent phone from Samsung and which reinforces my faith in their products!
63,5,"I bought this Galaxy S8 as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loves it."
64,5,Always good products from samsung. Would recommend.
65,5,"Used to have an iPhone and wanted to try something new. Read about some drawbacks about battery life some had experienced, but I haven’t seen any of these issues. Phone charges super fast too. So far I’m happy with the switch."
66,4,Love my Samsung Glaxy S8 coral blue. Great battery backup .
67,5,THERE ARE LITTLE HINTS THAT POP UP WHILE USING DIFFERENT FEATURES ON THE PHONE
68,5,It is by far the best phone I have ever had! I would recommend it to everyone!
69,5,Switched from IPhone to new Samsung S8. This phone has exceeded expectations.
70,5,Love this phone Has good battery Nice display Size is not to big to carry everywhere
71,5,"This phone is like a powerful computer for your pocket. I just upgraded from the S6 and it is familiar enough, but with so many great new features. The curved screen makes it nearly impossible to get a good screen protector on, but other than that, it's great."
72,5,I really love this phone! It's easy to use. I can text easily to my friends and take pictures anytime. I really like android much better than Apple. Best Buy was very patient when I was making up my mind about which carrier to use. They offered good information.
73,5,Great phone easy to operate takes great pictures. Like the curved screen.
74,5,I love my samsung s8. I have had plenty oh phones.. iPhones and androids. This s8 is hands down my favorite!
75,5,Nice feel when holding. Easy to change settings. Plenty of ringtones.
76,3,I like the quality of my new Samsung - Galaxy S8 64GB. I really like the Coral Blue color of this phone. The phone is reliable and easy to use. The camera takes good pictures. The battery life is at least ten hours. I rarely have any problems with this phone. I would recommend this phone.
77,5,I'm very happy with my new phone. The camera is excellent.
78,4,"This phone is amazing except it has issues with auto focus not working while recording at 60 fps...otherwise, it's a great phone and very fast."
79,5,"It is actually better than advertised that sure doesn't happen very often. Crystal clear display, great sound and fast."
80,5,I love this take great pictures I recommend to everyone
81,5,Great phone. Fast sleek awesome. Now wish I had waited for note 8
82,5,This is a great phone I don’t know how I ever lived with out it
83,4,"The Galaxy S8 is a good phone, but freezes and have to reset phone too often"
84,5,This phone is very nice it had all the features I was looking for.
85,5,"Great phone. I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 mini. I tend towards smaller phones - I went with this because of the half-priced deal during Cyber Monday. I am very happy with the functionality and performance of the S8. I have big hands and can use the finger scanner fairly successfully - my girlfriend has issues from time to time with the fingerprint and one-hand using this phone because she has small hands. I think it's a bit too tall for comfort inside of a guy's pocket. Unless I position the phone accordingly, it pushes into my hip when I sit down. Aside from the size of the phone, I really enjoy it. I am not an excessive user and do not use social media (or most of the other advanced features) on it. I charge the phone every 3 days (I put the phone in medium power saving mode) - my work iPhone 6s gets the same usage and I charge this every 1.5 days. It is fast enough if I need to research something on the internet, switch apps, load the camera or navigation. All in all, awesome product. Just wish it was an inch shorter in height."
86,5,"I love my new Galaxy S8.. it's the perfect size and the screen is so clear. haven't dropped it or gotten it wet yet, so far so good."
87,5,"Great great smartphone!! Highly recommend to anyone who has used any Samsung or Android phone in the past and has been satisfied. I had an S6 and loved it. And in the few weeks I've had this S8 I'm very happy. There's no lag whatsoever, which is an important thing for me. Takes awesome pictures. And the 64 gb of space means I'll pretty much never run out of space. My only complaint is I wish th speakers were louder, they seem kind of quiet even when at 100%. But this is relatively minor to me so I will still give this phone two thumbs up. Basically if you want an awesome awesome smart phone I recommend the S8."
88,5,I switched from a long time HTC loyal customer to the samsung galaxy. And i have to say im impressed! The battery lasts a long time! And the phone is overall a good user friendly product.
89,5,"Had to replace my phone due to a mishap but I have been happy with this device. It's beautiful, fast and full of great features. Only negative is the new charging usb-c port and needing to buy adapters."
90,5,This Galaxy S8 is absolutely the best phone out there now.I just love it.
91,4,Overall much improved from the Samsung S4 I upgraded. Some of the new features take some getting used to. Not all of them are perfected just yet.
92,4,"I decided to make the switch to this phone from my iPhone. A good decision, but it’s taking some getting used to."
93,5,"I have been using Samsung since the first Note came out. These devices have offered, in my opinion, the most dependable mobile devices available. I have always liked the Samsung interface with the Android powered OS. My best advice, is to truly research and explore what this phone offers. From the camera functions to the organizational side of the software."
94,5,"reviews were spot on; phone is as good as the reviews, most of which laced it among the best of this years models"
95,5,Great phone. Works fast. Great camera. No issues..
96,4,I don't use all the features but this phone takes great pics and videos. My main complaint is that the phone is really slow charging with the included USB cable and also with the Samsung wireless fast charger. My s7 charged up super fast with its included cable. The screen is good and the slim design is a plus.
97,4,"I personally have the S8+, but bought this for my wife for Christmas as a replacement for her 'dropped too many time and cracked the screen Galaxy S6'. No complaints other than it has froze up a few times which required holding a combination of keys (power, volume down, and Bixby button) to reset it.It may be a rouge app, but other than that it's been great with an amazing screen."
98,5,Good price around holidays - great upgrade and easy to use.
99,5,This is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone!
100,5,"Not a bulky phone. Easy to handle and use. Upgraded from an S6, this was an easy transition."
101,5,Upgraded phone from a Droid Turbo. So far this phone is great. Battery lasts and charges quickly.
102,5,"Just the right size, responds well to ""commands"", easy to use."
103,5,Move on from iPhone after 10 years with apple. Beautiful screen Fast customizable
104,5,I've had Iphones since 2009. I had to make the switch to Android since Iphone was no longer compatible with my needs which are research and productivity. I went to the Best Buy Mobile store and the representative discussed my needs with me an offered valuable feedback and recommendations which led me to purchase the Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB Arctic Silver. Wow!!! I cannot be happier with the service and product. Why Did I Wait So Long?
105,5,best android phone out there. the camera and overall quality are great.
106,5,"Really fast, it is great that it does not include the pre-installed apps from any company. Worked great with the sim I put in. Love it!"
107,5,"So far I've had a great experience with my phone. I had an LG before, but it was definitely time for an upgrade. The Galaxy was definitely a great pick."
108,5,"Loving this phone so far, had a galaxy s6 as well which was also excellent. Camera takes good pictures. Fingerprint reader takes some getting used to but isn't as bad as I expected it to be. Very quick phone, haven't had any problems with it yet."
109,4,Excellent value for price. Best Buy blue is nice. I am not disappointed.
110,5,"It has a lot of things to work with including camera, calendar, reminder etc."
111,5,I'm new to this product and its been a long time since I've had a smart phone. This phone is almost teaching me how to use it. It's wonderful.
112,5,"I like the size of it. Smaller than the last one I had. And actually, even though it's smaller, the screen is much bigger. Don't need my reading glasses to see my screen. My only regret is that I couldn't way to the new one came out so I am constantly updating my phone already."
113,5,"Purchased this phone after owning LGs, and Sony. This is by far better and the 64GB is the best thing I ever decided to get. Always has lots of storage for Apps I can not store on my SD card."
114,5,Easy to use and light weight. Screen is perfect and not overbearing.
115,4,"Seems very similar to the S7. I don't like the curved edge; I'm afraid of breaking the screen. It has nice features but I think they should have made it less slippery in your hand if they're going to put that curved screen on it; phone case is a must. Too bad they don't give you an option not to have the curved screen like they did with the s7. I am going to put 'yes' to recommend, but I don't really know for sure since I've only had it a few days."
116,4,This phone is great upgrade from the S5 that I previously owned.
117,5,an excellent product great camera the security is good apps great
118,4,"I recently purchased this device. I appreciate the slick design and speed. The camera appears to be oversensitive in certain low light conditions. Yet, it does pick up an image. I look forward to printing photos, which I have not done. Also, I do not appreciate all of the applications that pop-on for consideration, especially when you are not in search of apps. *However, I believe this to be the case with any phone purchased. We live in a world of apps."
119,5,"Thought the S7 was something, but this is ridiculous! The pictures are insane. Bought hub one too the same day as he was due for upgrade, switched to Samsung, and very happy with his S8 phone (black/grey)"
120,5,"No issues, sleek, non slip, closes completely. Slips easily in/out of pocket."
121,5,I was happy with my Samsung S6 and debated whether to stick with Samsung or go to the iPhone. I decided I wanted to stay with Android and I chose the Samsung S8. I'm happy with the purchase.
122,5,"I have always love a Samsung! My one regret, I couldn't afford the Galaxy note 8."
123,5,love this phone...works great and I would recommend to all my friends
124,5,Great phone. Very sleek and strong. Prefer Samsung over iPhone any day.
125,5,I love Samsung... My son loves it.. he went from a Galaxy 5 to 8.. truly seamless transition
126,5,"So far no issues, brilliant looking screen and sleek design. It was a challenge finding a screen protector that fit nicely but finally did."
127,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is an awesome phone. I love it's integration with AI (Bixby).
128,5,The Samsung galaxy S8 I purchased replaces my fourth iPhone. The infinity edge screen is brilliant. Android provide so much more freedom than iOS.
129,5,"The phone is great especially for the money, the camera is decent and the phone is lightening fast."
130,5,I love my new phone samsung makes just the best cellphones
131,5,"I say that it is Excellent because it has every feature you would want in a phone and the sales staff can assist in finding all of the new features as well as transferring data. Unlocked was more costly but with BB discounts it still made it more feasible not to be locked into a contract. The camera is excellent, voice, fingerprint and facial recognition great.."
132,5,The phone is really nice and performs well. Just what I expected.
133,4,"Works great, easy to use. Battery seems to last longer than the S5."
134,5,I recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy 8S. I originally went to the Verizon Store to get assistance with upgrading 2 phones on my plan. I decided to leave Verizon and come to Best Buy to look at some other items because of the wait time and I'm glad I did. The Samsung 8S cost a lot less at Best Buy and the wait time and technician was very helpful with recommending other products and services providing for a better shopping experience with all the savings and discounts I received.
135,4,"Great phone, big screen. Ive had a few problems with it frezzing up on me but i restart it and its fine."
136,5,Very pleased with our purchase! Phone works great!
137,5,"Great all round technology , design , functionality . Good hand feel , manipulation , screen quality . Camera has me using it in situations I previously used hi end SLR . Samsung apps and support top notch ."
138,5,The sraff at best buy had always been helpfull and Knowledgeable
139,5,Works very well. I would definitely recommend the Samsung S8
140,5,The Samsung 8 is the best phone on the market. Forget iPhone.
141,4,"Not a bad phone, definitely need to get a case and screen protection"
142,3,"It's an Android, acts like one, better battery life but still just an Android. Not worth $800 which is why I rated it 3 stars."
143,5,"I was leery of getting an upgrade after hearing lots of things about some of the new phones, but I love my new phone. It’s so easy to navigate and the camera is amazing. The battery lasts so much longer too! It takes my fingerprint unlock easily which was a problem on my old phone."
144,5,Love Samsung glad to have. The battery charges very quickly and last
145,5,This phone is ideal for even the least tech savvy person . It's good for adults and teenager's alike.
146,5,I would recommend this phone to anyone. It's good for teenager's and adults alike.
147,5,"We got this S8 for my wife who was coming from an S6. She had been luke warm about the S6 and never seemed truly happy with it. Since having the S8 for a few months now, she has said she loves it. Excellent battery life was her main like along with a great camera."
148,5,Love this color which is specific to Best Buy! Easy to use phone
149,5,Easy to use phone and great for beginning users...
150,5,Great phone for beginners. Easy to use and a big screen
151,5,"The Samsung S8 is a great phone, easy to use, great features, & competively priced."
152,5,"I purchased this to replace a Galaxy S6 Edge. Very aesthetically pleasing phone. Enter outer shell is made of glass. With that said, within 2 weeks of owning it, I dropped it and the back part of case cracked! Not the fault of the phone. User error. Phone still works. Price at Best Buy better than purchasing directly with Verizon for exact phone. I then sent the S6 Edge back to Verizon for bill credit as part of their ""trade in"" program."
153,5,Holds a charge all day. Easy to use and the right size for a pocket.
154,5,This is very good product and I would like to buy a new one for my family. Thank You Bestbuy.
155,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 exceeds my expectations. Samsung continues a long line of excellance in their android pnone
156,4,Chose the regular S8 because I wanted something to fit my hand better. The smaller size and taller frame (than my previous phone) fits really well.
157,4,Upgraded fro Galaxy 5 to Galaxy 8. Faster with more storage.
158,5,I liked all of the extra features that this phone gives through Samsung. The full edge to edge screen is very handy. The price is pretty hefty but all of the top contenders ran about the same price.
159,5,"Exactly as ordered.................,,,,,,,,......."
160,4,Great phone. Very happy. Tried the Google pixel and didn't like it at all. I'll stay with Samsung products.
161,5,So many features ! Samsung’s technology amazes me everyday.
162,4,I have been using Samsung phones and products for some time now and I am very happy with the phone. They have not let me down yet!
163,5,My wife loves her s8! She hasn't had a new phone in a while so she was a little worried about the upgrade but has lived it since getting it!
164,4,Went from I Phone to this phone. Still gettijng used to it. Battery seems to last about 2 days
165,5,I really like the Galaxy s8. Easy to use and a good size.
166,5,I have been an iPhone user since the 3. My iPhone card reader went out on my 7. They said it would cost $349 to fix. I had the phone for only 14 months. So with the great price on he S8 at Best Buy I made the switch. Best move ever! Wish I had done it sooner. Love it!
167,5,"Great phone, and the features are great, one of the best phones I ever purchased"
168,5,Great phone charges fast keeps a charge for three days!! Great. Camera too
169,5,Awesome phone keeps a charge for 3 days. Has great features. Camera is nice too. The volume on the phone is great too
170,5,The newest in the galaxy collection is the best so far. It is faster and you can see the difference.
171,5,The Galaxy S8 is a nice upgrade from the S& Edge. It takes a little getting use to on its functionality. Caution - get a case! It is all glass and hard to hold onto.
172,5,Excellent phone for the price! Has more memory than the Iphone and you can expand extra with micro sd card.
173,5,Great product. Easy process. The best buy rep made the process simple and enjoyable.
174,5,Very easy transition and user friendly. Colors more vivid and camera takes beautiful pictures.
175,5,S8 is a good upgrade from my previous S5. Screen is excellent. I'm a little concerned about durability. Only time and use will tell.
176,5,This phone is taking some adjusting since i came from an LG phone.
177,5,The best phone I have ever had. Samsung can't be beat.
178,3,"The Phone is awesome! But the phone is locked with Verizon. I wanted to use it with a different carrier but they could not unlock it for me. Both Best Buy and Verizon said they cannot unlock the phone. According to Verizon, they never lock their Galaxy S8 phone! So I was stuck in a limbo. I ended up returning the phone."
179,4,"I like the S8 - except for 2 things. #1 I DO NOT like the fingerprint button on the back next to the camera lens. I have small hands and this feature is not convenient for me. So, I have to use a PIN to unlock. #2 I do not like the small size of the home button and the general ""thinness"" of the clock time. Without my glasses it is difficult to read. I want BOLD."
180,3,"After lusting over the new curved edge phone, I decided it was time to upgrade when my older Samsung device started running out of memory and battery life. Unfortunately, it took less than 24 hours to confirm that I really didn't care for this phone. There are a number of reasons why, but they all seem to be linked to the curved edge glass. Sure, it looks interesting, but it isn't functional. First, it effectively reduces the useable area of the screen. The images do wrap, as does the keypad. But it takes a different finger pressure to press a key along the edge as it does anywhere in the middle. So you needed to press harder to hit the Q, A, Z, P, L and period keys than you do the middle keys. Which is to say, just typing a text or email, one has to use different stroke pressures to type fluently. This variation of required pressure is extended to the phone's built-in functionality. It required a hard press to awaken the phone, but a different pressure to use it once open. This seems to be due to eliminating the bottom button. I like the button, and believe it makes the virtual items of the phone far more valuable with it in place. I can go on, but the message is the same. I chose to return the S8 and get an S7, which I LOVE. I would say that I am a brand loyalist. I have confidently purchase Samsung phones and television for years. Perhaps I am old school, but I hope that Samsung comes out with a different phone in a couple of years when my S7 is getting tired. I will not upgrade to a curved glass model in the future."
181,5,"Love it so far, no problems, works great, cool features."
182,5,Love the phone. phone has great apps and strong wi fi
183,3,"Wish I would have paid the extra $100 or so to get the 8+. While the S8 is a competent phone, I'm afraid that most of the pictures seen in FB are cut off on the sides so I don't see the full image. Also, the screen almost needs to be pushed down to work, not like my old S5 which really was a ""touch-screen"". Don't like the curved edge as it makes it hard to type a zero, etc. Will put up with this for a couple of years and then upgrade to a wider screen."
184,5,Works great took some getting used to after coming different brands
185,5,Amazing speed. It has a great display and the battery life is awesome.
186,5,"I like everything about this phone. It does so much beyond what I have figured out, but it is exciting to explore and learn new things. The only negative is the way you access the phone initially-particularly in low light situations (as compared with the Samsung 5)."
187,5,"I S8 is a great upgrade form the S7 Edge, The phones size feels better in your hand the the S7 edge. Great display, camera. Best Buy always has great deals on Samsungs."
188,5,"Great new camera features, quick and responsive! I would definitely buy this phone again."
189,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a nice upgrade from the S5 that I had. Phone is super easy to handle. I love the size and the design. My favorite is the camera. The least favorite feature is Bixby.... She's and idiot and can never understand me. LOL
190,5,I don't notice much difference from my last Samsung except that everyone tells me how great my photos look. I agree.
191,5,"Love the s7 and there are slight improvements to the s8. Not the largest fan of ""infinity screen"" but love that still has expandable storage, headphone jack, wireless charging, and c type port."
192,5,What can I say? It's a Samsung. High quality as expected. Coral blue is beautiful.
193,5,This phone has plenty of space for all of my apps without slowing it down. It's easy to use and so much faster than my Samsung Galaxy 6! It was easy to set up as well!
194,4,I love the capabilities of the Galaxy S8 as well as the price. Definitely a steal.
195,5,Finally had to upgrade and love this phone. Not too much different from my old phone but love all the new features so far. It's also a perfect size for me.
196,5,We have had a Samsung phone for years and we love it.
197,4,So far the phone is pretty cool. The camera on this is excellent.
198,5,It became time to replace my moms S5 so I upgraded her to the S8 and no complaints yet...Samsung could definitely work on their app that switches everything over from one phone to another.
199,4,I am an longtime Samsung Galaxy customer and just upgraded to the S8. So far it seems to be the same great product I am used to. Only complaint is that the screen seems to scratch easier than my previous galaxys did. After 2 weeks I noticed a lot of scratches and decided to buy a screen protector. Besides that I love the camera and am looking foward to seeing the waterproof capabilities in action.
200,5,"The features of the phones these days are pretty standard, but this was the first time I used the HD calling and I love it... calls are so crisp and clear!"
201,5,love the phone except relearning all the different funktions
202,5,Best phone yet . Very powerful. Lots of memory smooth operation.
203,5,I had the 5 previously and didn't think it would be a big difference to upgrade. The battery is much better. I can go 2 days without charging it.
204,5,Phone works great. Fast. Battery last a decent time. Pics are great.
205,5,"Great phone. Switched from iPhone to this phone. At first, I only got the phone because it was on sale, and WAY cheaper than the new iPhone, with very comparable capabilities. Love the phone as it is very lightweight, a good size, great video and sound quality. Very happy."
206,4,Battery is better than expected. Many issues with GPS signal dropping and calls dropping. I liked many things about the S5 better but the S8 is a beautiful phone with a much better camera. BIXBY is pretty useless. Cannot disable phone wake from hard press on the front screen home button location - poor oversight. It turns on very easily in your pocket.
207,5,Very easy to operate. I'm still learning all the features of my new phone.
208,5,Best size and best features. Camera is super clear. Smart View is something that don't have iphone. The beast!!
209,5,My son loves the ease of use. Great camera and battery life is very good.
210,5,"This product has many great features... I love the camera, the bix by, smart switch, Samsung health and collect, etc.. Basically, I love everything about this product..."
211,5,Great phone big improvement over my Galaxy S6. Another great Samsung product.
212,4,The phone keeps pausing whenever I'm watching TV or listening to the radio.
213,5,This is my third smart phone.samsung just keeps greeting better.fast and problem free.excellent picture quality
214,5,"High quality, TOP camera (my main reason to buy this phone)."
215,5,THIS IS THE 2ND SAMSUNG PHONE I'VE OWNED. IT IS REALLY USER FRIENDLY AND THE PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!!!!!
216,4,Happy with this phone. Much more storage and much faster than the s6.
217,4,Much faster than my last phone....s6. Love all the extra storage. Lots of case options.
218,5,Great quality - performance. Screen/cameras SUPER!
219,5,"Like the phone despite problems with the calendar and Voice to text. Found fixes for both online. Not perfect, but has lots of possibilities, great battery time, and much better than the Galaxy s7. Took a while to get used to the longer phone. Expect learning curve."
220,4,"Overall, the phone is good. I like the size and most of the layout. However, there are some aspects I don't like. The edge can be annoying when trying to click on something laying on it. In addition, the phone is very fragile because mostly glass sides......so I'm afraid it will crack on any drop."
221,4,Christmas gift to my son after his Samsung S6 broke
222,4,Very fast and no idle item very convincing as a good purchase
223,5,Great phone first time user of a galaxy! Love the picture quality
224,5,I would recommend this phone it works great and it does not take so much space in your pocket
225,5,I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 and couldn't be more pleased. Excellent screen size and graphics. Tempered glass screen protectors are a little tricky with the curved screen but I bought the Otter Box Commuter case and it's well protected.
226,5,"Bought an unlocked version as it allows me to easily switch between US carriers and International Carriers as I tend to travel internationally quite a bit and switching to local plans is much more easier than being locked in with Verizon, ATT, Sprint or T-Mobile or anyone else."
227,5,I am not a big fan of changing phones but I am very happy with my decision to upgrade with Galaxy 8. Battery life is excellent and I love the large screen. Seems to charge faster than my old phone as well. Easy to operate even for a novice like myself.
228,5,Great phone by Samsung. They make great products in my opinion. It is still going strong today
229,5,Fun features. Awesome screen. Really comfortable and sleek.
230,5,for my son. he wanted an iPhone but he's very happy with this one
231,5,Had a Galaxy 4 and was worried about s8 being too complicated but it's not
232,5,I moved from a Moto X pure and it is no comparison. Wish i would have made the change long ago.
233,5,It was about time for me to get an upgrade. Everything runs smoothly and quickly; the interface is easy to interact with and the curved edges give it a sophisticated look.
234,5,"This phone is working great for me, and I love the color."
235,5,"Been about a month now, battery life is great phone functions flawlessly disregarding a few hiccups here and there most likely due to the google android software updates which are always fixing one thing like noise issues in camera app to call quality issues in phone app. Make sure you get a case, dropped twice thanks to commuter case there are no damages other then my heart dropping in slow motion . Enjoy a great device at an awesome price compared to Apple's thousand dollar iphone"
236,5,This phone has all the bells and whistles I purchased for my husband he loves it.
237,4,"beautiful and handy device, great camera, and awesome screen colors and resolution, however not so glad with battery life"
238,5,The most user friendly device I ever used and worked with.
239,5,Great phone with outstanding features. I have not had any problems with this phone and I am totally pleased.
240,5,"Excellent phone, this was purchased for my husband and he loves it."
241,5,"Great smartphone over all, great pictures, great cellular reception,great features all around."
242,4,"This is a great phone, I don't like the edge so I turned it off and I find the keypad to be not as forgiving as the iPhone. Other then that this phone is fast and if you can just get by on by on the learning curve from iPhone you'll this one. I do recommend a case and one of those pop sockets because to hold the device because the edge is touchy and will suddenly move you another app if you have big mitts like me."
243,5,"As a former iPhone user, I'm happy to move on to a more mature and sophisticated phone."
244,5,As a former iPhone user...I have zero regrets transitioning to a Samsung. The phone is so much more mature and sophisticated!
245,5,Great phone. Great pictures and easy phone to use.
246,5,"Easily able to use and function right away. Performs well, camera is crystal clear and capture wonderful image. No bitter or crashes. Send txt, share fine and capture very quickly and smooth without any blurs or required lense wiping. Just an amazing experience with this Samsung galaxy 8 than any other Samsung galaxy phone I've ever owned in the past this is tops them all off. This is just extraordinary!!!"
247,5,The Samsung 8 is an absolute great phone. Easy to learn too
248,5,I upgraded my fiance to the S8 from S6....the speed and stability are amazing
249,5,We purchased 3 Samsung Galaxy S8 phones for the family
250,5,Great phone i ever got. Phone is the best one i ever had.
251,5,Love Verizon Service Great Service from the employees at Best Buy
252,5,Service w Verizon is excellent. Best Buy service great too.
253,4,Phone works just fine. I am happy with the product
254,5,"Great phone, works well, easy to set-up, long battery life."
255,4,Better than my last Samsung. Don't like the wrap around glass. Prefer edges
256,5,Love the new Samsung Galaxy S8 edge! It's a great phone.
257,3,"I tried switching from an iPhone to an android, and this is the device I used. I lasted a week before taking it back. There were some features that I really liked about this phone, but they weren’t enough to outweigh my frustrations. Perhaps if I had started my smart phone journey with a droid I would have loved this phone. And perhaps I was a bit jaded by the horrible screen protector I ended up with, but I have since gone back to an iPhone. Some of the things I liked were that the screen was the whole front of the device. The fact that certain apps came preloaded was actually nice. I also like the functionality of some of the phone’s features as well. However, the screen protector was a piece of junk (as stated in another review). And, I have since realized that the curved screen might not be such a good idea. Yes, it does look cool and allows for additional options. However, it is also harder to protect. Coming from a clumsy person, this is a HUGE deal breaker. I don’t want to live paranoid of dropping my phone and having the screen protector crack, or worse because the protector fell off. Also, coming from an iPhone, the functional differences between the two are bigger than I think they should be. For one, I was almost late getting up for work because my alarm didn’t go off. My iPhone allows alarms to work despite Do Not Disturb being on. Why would I guess I had to change a setting on the droid to allow that? Come on designers! Some cooperation between brands would be nice. Not all of us want to be SO product loyal because we are forced to. I also love the new (Apple) wireless charging capability. I’m a bit annoyed that the technology has been out there for years, but Apple has finally gotten on the bandwagon. There is no reason for exclusivity like that! I’m going to say that I wouldn’t recommend this product because I have gone back to an iPhone. If you are already a droid user, you may love this upgrade."
258,5,"I had a Galaxy s5 so getting the s8 was a huge jump forward. It has beautiful photo quality smooth resolution. It's a very fast phone and I love the storage capacity. Only negative thing is the Bixby button, I keep pressing it on accident and I don't like the headphone jack outlet on the bottom of the phone."
259,5,So far great phone! Meets galaxy expectations. Great camera and loud speaker.
260,5,User friendly phone with sleek design. Easy to navigate.
261,5,would highly recommend. upgraded from Samsung 6 to the 8.
262,5,Loved it so much I got another for my daughter! Very easy to use and learn.
263,5,"Upgraded from a 5 so I was ling overdue Glad to have faster speed, smaller overall device and larger storage"
264,4,Takes some getting used to the curved edges. Also has a feature called Bixby that am still trying to get used to.
265,5,I bought the coral phone for my wife. We trade phones about every two years. So the S6's went away and we go S8's. We are very happy with them.
266,5,I got the coral blue phone. Its amazing. I like it much better than the S6 which I really loved too. I traded in after 2 years and I am very satisfied with it.
267,5,Love the security options this phone offers and the long battery life.
268,5,"Love the long battery life, screen size, and security protection options."
269,5,Seems to be a well designed phone. The camera takes phenomenal pix.
270,5,"Good quality ,fast processor,awesome screen,another quality samsung product"
271,5,Good size phone. Volume is excellent. Keyboard is easy to use.
272,5,"I've had apple and galaxy will never own anything other than galaxy!!! The only thing I don't like about the galaxy is the Bixby button can't be changed to another function, still give a 5 star!!"
273,5,Love this phone alot cheaper through best buy then through verizon
274,5,Most amazing phone I have ever used. So many features I don't know where to begin.
275,5,Replaced my iPhone with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and I am so happy I did!
276,5,This phone is much improved over my old Samsung S4. It charges quickly and the sound is exceptional.
277,5,Great phone. Lots of new features over my old HTC. Easy to adapt to. Samsung provides user manual upon request.
278,5,"I was buying "" a first"" smart phone for my wife at Xmas. Setting it up without her knowing and keeping her current phone working took extra help."
279,5,I've had this phone since Christmas and so far it has performed extremely well. Great camera and battery life seems to be very good as well. It charges very fast and I hope it continues to please.
280,5,Upgraded to this from s7. Has alot of nice features. Easier to use.
281,5,I can now send and receive calls. No dropped calls
282,5,I like the phone and how it looks and it works really well
283,5,It has some features I didn't have on my old phone and I really like it
284,4,The phone is easy to use and is the right size. I do miss my note 4. The S8 for some reason doesn't have voice to text feature and I used it a lot. All and all the S8 is a good phone.
285,5,"I purchased two of these phones: one for my husband and one for my son. They are perfect. Both phones were upgraded from Galaxy fives. The newer version offers so many extra features and has a slim, sleek design. Samsung has not disappointed when it comes to the features and ease of use."
286,5,Love this phone ! The picture quality is amazing. My son is really enjoying his new phone
287,4,Our son was in need of a new phone. We choose this phone as he already had a Samsung and had been happy with it. The ordering process was easy and delivery was quick. We were able to set up the new phone easily ourselves at home. I would have given 5 stars if the cost of the phone was less.
288,5,"I've always used androids, so this was pretty easy for me to adapt to. The sales people were able to use a program to switch all the info from my old phone to my new one, which was nice. The first couple days I had it, it used battery power like crazy but I learned a couple tips online about how to put certain apps to 'sleep' and now it's great!"
289,5,Phone works great! Has new features from galaxy 7. Very convenient user friendly phone.
290,4,"Always love new technology and my prior phone was bogged down & laggy. This is my first Galaxy. Love the infinity screen, and the pictures are beautiful and vibrant. The cast function isnt as easy to find & use as it was on my Droid Turbo 2. Havent found anything i hate thus far. Love the ""close all"" function where i can close all apps at once instead of one by one."
291,5,"Great upgrade from my old phone, good deal as well."
292,5,"Samsung does it again. Had a 5, then a 7. The 8 is great."
293,5,Love my new phone. The camera is great. I like the slim design and size fits nicely in my back pocket.
294,5,This is the best phone that I have ever had everyone needs this phone can't wait for the next gen
295,5,I forgot how much I hated Apple until I upgraded to a Samsung.
296,5,No problems with this phone so far. Holds the charge well. Easy transition from an LG phone.
297,4,This was my first purchase at Best buy. Hope every purchases will be worth.
298,4,Upgraded from a Galaxy S5. Of course it's faster and hold battery life longer.
299,5,It's quick and responsive. Trully a beautiful phone and the infinity screen does wonderful. I really like the interface Samsung has laid over the Android UI. It really has some friendly and intuitive features that I think the newer versions of Android could learn and adapt from.
300,5,Upgraded from a s6 and really enjoy the new features.
301,5,Great phone with awesome features for its model . Never disappoint
302,5,Very cool color and awesome phone. It's like having a mini computer in your hand. Great choice for a phone. Samsung has done it again.
303,5,So very pleased with this purchase and Best Buy was so very helpful.
304,4,"Overall the phone is pretty impressive, but the fingerprint scanner doesn't seem to work reliably. Lotta comments about this on the forums. Maybe related to recent software updates? Samsung seems either unconcerned or clueless, but either way it's really annoying."
305,5,"After owning an S3 many years ago, I was hesitant to own another Samsung phone. I'm glad I decided to give this one a shot! By far th3 best phone I've owned"
306,5,Really enjoy my new phone. Easy to use and understand as it gives instructions every step of the way. Good deal with $300 discount.
307,5,This is my first Samsung Galaxy. Compared to the iPhone's it was easier to set up initially. It walks me through everything when first using something new on my phone.
308,5,This is a replacement/upgrade from a Galaxy S5. Couldn't be happier. Still playing with all the features. Will have to report back in a few weeks.
309,5,Great phone and great deal going on. It is working better than I expected
310,4,I really like it it's running all my apps will. Just trying to get used to the screen
311,4,"great camera ,very light to hold, battery is not bad"
312,5,This is my 5th phone and this is the best phone for the money (2 for one). I never thought I would buy a phone that does as much as this one does.
313,4,Bought this phone for my son and he seems to really like it
314,4,The camera is awesome. The phone is very fast. Overall great phone.
315,5,Great smartphone with lots of features and like the vivid screen.
316,5,"This is a great phone,I had a Samsung Note 4 that needed to be replaced and wanted a new Samsung S8 and I love all the new features that my Note 4 didn't have."
317,5,I really like this phone. The battery life is great. Vivid screen and excellent camera.
318,5,It was for my wife for her birthday and she loves it
319,4,"Coming from a Galaxy S5 this is like jumping light years ahead. Pros: The screen is nice to look at The phone is fast and responsive. Cons: screen seems thinner and more delicate that the S6, this thing is like a glass sandwich. Iris scanner still a little buggy and not ready for prime-time."
320,2,"I love the phone hardware, especially when compared to my LG G3 (yes, G3) that suddenly bricked itself on Black Friday. But Bixby is the most annoying piece of software I've ever, ever experienced. Now the voice recognition doesn't even work despite my wasting a good 10-15 minutes playing with it. You can't even get rid of it, and the button on the left side is the most likely place for you to press it unintentionally. It makes Clippy look like the best thing ever, and at least you could shut Clippy off!"
321,5,"Migrating from a Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy S8 was much better than expected... improved performance, network and boot up time."
322,5,My kids love there New phone. My daughter uses it a lot for school.
323,5,"This phone makes me glad I switched back to Samsung from iPhone! Easy to use, and Samsung will never make their phones more than the battery can handle!"
324,4,Good phone with great camera quality and fast processing time
325,5,Its only at best buy. What is not to love best color
326,5,The Galaxy 8 is vastly better compared to the Galaxy III. Had recharge the III several times a day and with the * only once a day.
327,5,Wonderful phone... With great camera and amazing design in
328,5,It is a good cellphone. When I beaught it I cannot believe how good cellphone I beaught
329,5,I purchased the phone as a gift for my daughter and she loves it! Its a great upgrade to the phone she had before. We are completely satisfied with our purchase.
330,5,Wonderful phone... Amazing camera and great looks.
331,4,Would not recommend. No improvement over S5. Too sensitive. Automatically changes screens. No one can explain why there are issues
332,5,Got this for the wife for Christmas and she loves her new phone.
333,5,Samsung quality with great new features. Easy to transition from old Note 4.
334,4,Love my Galaxy 8 in best buy exclusive color- Coral Blue. Only problem I have is the incessant pop up saying my phone is heavily infected bc of adult content. This phone runs smoothly. It is quick and sized perfectly.
335,5,Love my new phone. Had been a Galaxy owner till I changed back to a droid turbo but am glad to be back to a Galaxy.
336,5,I love this phone it's fast and I like NEW features it's has.
337,5,"I love this phone. So happy that Samsung put the external sd card back into this phone. Phone is very easy to use ,great camera too"
338,5,Nice screen and nice camera. At the same time it still is small enough to carry everywhere
339,5,"The best phone I've had so far, although my last 4-5 phones have been Samsung. It has many functions that I still do not discover, the apps run very fast, and Bixby is very helpful. Personally, I do not like covers, but this S8 is like a soap bar in your hands. I definitely recommend it."
340,5,The galaxy s8 is much better than the s7 it has a really good battery life and it doesn't slag like the s7
341,5,This was a great item. Fast delivery and responsive staff
342,5,"My best phone ever....great storage capacity, speed of operation..and very ghood battery."
343,5,The style is so nice and curve. It is also light. The front camera and back camera care also nice!
344,5,"Don't hesitate to get one. I'm very pleased with the phone. I find the battery charge lasts long and very quick to charge. The screen is great, reaction to touch is perfect. Other family members have iPhones, but I'll keep my Samsung!"
345,5,"Great phone, great price point at best buy. Would recommend"
346,4,"I like the aspect ratio of the V30 for heavy usage personally, but the S8 fits in pocket better and has some proccessor improvements. Pics are saturated compared to LG which can be made vivid in post processing if desired."
347,5,This is a great phone I bought it for my wife and she loves it
348,4,It was easy to move through the settings and apps. The gentleman who sold it to me showed me the basics and I went from there
349,4,I've gotten many years of use out of every Samsung Galaxy product I own and I expect the same for this phone. So far I haven't had any issues.
350,5,Bought it recently for my teenager son as a replacement for the iPhone 6s. He loves it so far specifically the customization features.
351,5,I love this phone! The battery life is fantastic and picture quality is awesome.
352,4,i gad to buy this after a update on my s6 that made it boot loop and now wont do anything
353,5,Got this for my sister & she absolutely loves it. Camera is amazing.
354,5,Camera is spectacular Phone is very fast Light weight
355,4,"I miss the physical home button, but love everything else about the phone."
356,5,"Great phone, many great functions and the display is big and bright."
357,5,"Amazing camera quality, absolutely love this phone over all. Glad I made this purchase it was well worth it! :)"
358,5,It works wonderful especially take photo. I compared pictures with iphone8 and results are totally different. It is not clear and vivid.
359,5,I love this phone. I chose this version instead of the Galaxy 8 Note due to the size. I have smaller hands and this one works best. The note is larger than the 8s.
360,5,"Look and feel of the phone is awesome. one of the best camera only Con is placement of the fingerprint scanner , rest everything is nice"
361,5,"Like the slim look with curved screen. Thumb scan works pretty well, gives option for multiple finger scans so you have option if you have a cut. Quick phone. Battery lasts about 24Hrs with normal usage. Some internet, apps, etc."
362,5,I love my new S8. I was looking for something that wasn't gigantic that I could use for work. This phone fits the bill perfectly!
363,5,"Upgraded from the S5. Love the phone. Got the black one as a Christmas present for the wife. Got the blue one for myself. I noticed slight differences in the apps that are on the 2 phones. Same phone, same store, ordered on different days, but a few different preinstalled apps than on my phone."
364,5,This phone does it all. It has all the features one needs. It's fast and easy to use with great color OLED screen. Camera takes beautiful pictures. Very satisfied with my purchase at Best Buy.
365,5,"Nice interface, big memory, great camera -- I am glad to use this phone now."
366,5,Great tv easy to set up and install. good picture and sound.
367,5,"I honestly thought I was going to have trouble getting used to the S8, having previously been used to the S5, but this has been a smooth transition. Very easy to use and customize to fit my needs, and I like that it has a much more spare than previous models."
368,5,I recently purchased a Samsung galaxy s8. It's an amazing phone
369,5,Infinity screen check fast processor check easy on fingers somewhat amazing camera you know it you wont be disappointed.
370,5,I have enjoyed the previous Samsung Galaxy S6 but the S8/S8+ are the best version yet! Very nice!
371,5,this is my wife's phone. She had some trying times trying to find stuff on the new phone over our old S4. Got our granddaughter to help out and now she is really enjoying this new phone. She is constantly finding new things her phone can do. She especially likes that voice feature of the phone.
372,5,"took a while to get used to the things that were different from our S4. we actually had to go to Best Buy several times to get someone to show us where and how to do things. But, after playing with it for a few days, we are not enjoying all the updates we are getting over our old phone"
373,4,"Great phone still learning to use it, Has some features my other phone did not have , i am still learning to use."
374,4,This phone is great and takes good quality pictures and the features are amazing!
375,5,"excellent memory, good storage and many other pluses. I upgraded from my S5 and I'm glad I did - Bixbie is a good product to use with this phone - definitely worth trying."
376,4,"Love processor speed, resolution and everything in general. Headphones pretty nice too"
377,5,"I am really happy with the purchase. i was scared at first because i heard people not receiving update on unlock phones plus the compatibility issues with the carrier but this phone has working amazing in my AT&T line, i really was due for a upgrade"
378,4,this new phone works better then my last phone so I like it
379,3,"The edged screen is a waste and sticks up from most regular cases making it more prone to breaking. There's no IR Blaster. Phone is good. Love sd external storage option! Love the re location of the fingerprint scanner and the different keys for screenshots. I do find the Dex Station a very good improvement and excited to have it for traveling presentations! Otherwise, not a lot of noteworthy upgrades from my S6 really. I just had to have more storage."
380,5,Got same phone for my husband. It's great phone!! I was a great Xmas present!
381,5,Excellent phone and great service. I will always be a Samsung costumer!
382,5,"I am a big fan of Samsung and believe they have great quality products. The picture is awesome and all the features are really cool. It does a lot more than I expected. The speed, picture, and integration with smart-home features makes this the best phone for me."
383,5,"This was a replacement for my daughter's S5 and it's not an exaggeration to say that she LOVES the S8. It is much faster, more storage, clearer details on the screen, and much better camera. I have heard that the screen cracks easier, but so far, no problem."
384,5,"I had to upgrade because the battery on my Samsung Galaxy S7 was shot and wouldn't hold a charge. I've only had the phone for a few weeks, but so far I love it."
385,4,"I was a little afraid to buy a Samsung as I heard a lot of -ve reviews from friends who used Samsung's previous phones, but I am glad I bought this and got rid of my iPhone. So many usable features, amazing camera, amazing display, and so many things worth mentioning. The only slight downside is - it is still not as robust as an iPhone. When I try to copy a lot of pictures from it to my computer, the phone hangs. So, I copy a few at a time. That works perfectly fine for me. I was told that I would like it only for a few months and then will be fed up. It's been 7 months and I am still happy to say to all my Apple fan friends ""You should upgrade to Samsung now""."
386,5,I bought this for my wife a few months ago and she loves it. It has an amazing camera.
387,5,Was a Christmas gift for my 14 year old. He loves is so far.
388,5,This was a major upgrade from my Samsung J3 2016. Not sure if I need all the of the new functions but I appreciate the Google voice commands and much improved camera quality.
389,5,Bought this as a gift and it turned out to be the perfect gift!! The phone is loved by it new owner!!
390,5,Phone for our daughter. She seems to like it very much!
391,5,"Great size, the graphics are amazing and curved edges are helpful as well"
392,5,"Upgraded from an S5 to the S8, what a difference!!"
393,5,"Really good phone, screen is very nice. The phone is really fast. Personally I returned this and got the note 8 for the same price."
394,5,I like this item a lot. Read through the reviews and went with this product from best buy.
395,5,This is a replacement/upgrade to my Samsung S5. So far this phone is much faster and has a greater battery life.
396,5,"would buy again in a minute, love my Christmas present"
397,5,"Love my new toy, having fun picking my accessaries. have always loved Samsung products, needless to say I am a very happy girl"
398,4,"This is a good advanced smartphone. The only thing I don't like is the keyboard, it is very bad with getting correct words."
399,5,Right on par with Pixel and Iphone. Just depends on your taste in OS.
400,5,"Did not plan on buying a new phone but my LG G4 only 2 yrs old, died. Researched Galaxy S8, Pixel 2 and iPhone 7. Based on Best Buy promotions, I went with the Galaxy S8. Sound clarity is very good, good camera, has headphone jack and AKG earbuds are included with the phone. Screen is bright and clear. Battery life is very good which was important to me. Although I've always had Androids, still a bit of a learning curve to learn all of the S8's capabilities. So far, very dependable and I am pleased with my choice. Just hope that it lives longer than my LG G4 did because the price of ALL phones is ridiculous .. IMO."
401,5,This is the best phone I have ever owned. Aside from having to learn the OS upgrades and how they affect the device and/or APS I am really enjoying the faster processor speed. My former phone was a Samsung S4. No comparison.
402,5,"Camera was a gift and a large upgrade from a 6 year old HTC. The end user is not the most gadget savvy person, but the intuitive nature of the S8 makes the transition to the new phone as seamless as one could imagine"
403,3,"Finally upgraded to S8 from my trusty Samsung Note 2. The new S8 drops calls nearly every call lasting over 10 minutes or so. Also it's too sensitive to movement. Hate the constant ""notifications"" pop ups at beginning of phone use. Tried everything to make this feature go away."
404,5,I absolutely love my upgrade from and S6. The durability and quality are incomparable.
405,5,The screen is very crisp. It takes amazing videos as well.
406,4,"The phone is much less user friendly than my old S3 which I hated giving up, but had no choice as it was finally on it's last legs. I really miss not being able to control the volume of all items at one time by just pressing the volume button on the side of the phone. I find it irritating to have to adjust each separately with a drop down menu. I prefer the smaller S3 as this phone is harder for me to hold and tires my hand out. I do, however, like the quality of the pictures it takes as well as the increased amount of storage."
407,5,The service was great. Helpful & efficient. All options were explained; making the choice easy.
408,5,"Boy, do I like this phone. Last phone was Galaxy 3 and it lasted 6 years! Big reason why I went with this upgrade. Still learning all the bells and whistles, but it's been great so far!"
409,5,my son first phone and he loves it. He keep texting his sister all day lol
410,5,"my daughters first phone and she loves it, she can’t wait to get everybody number"
411,5,"purchased for my wife to replace her iphone 6plus. i was concerned she would miss the iphone, but she loves this new phone. she loves changing ringtones and notification sounds with the zedge app, or taking a screenshot with a wipe of her hand and lets not forget expandable storage."
412,4,I like my Samsung 8. It's a little diffeerent from my 5 but I am getting used to it. My only criticism would be that it comes with a lot of apps that I don't use and doesn't leave a lot of room for the apps I choose.
413,4,"Bought this for my husband as he was using an S4. Great upgrade, still getting used to all the new and upgraded features"
414,4,"Upgraded from my S4. Great phone, still getting used to all the new and upgraded features."
415,5,I purchased this phone for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it!
416,5,Samsung Galaxy 8 is user friendly. The camera is excellent taking beautiful clear and colorful pics. The sound is clear and concise.
417,5,"The offer of $300 off the Samsung Galaxy S8 was a great value and the phone has lived up to the hype. Battery lasts a long time, call quality is excellent, and the camera takes very good pictures. I definitely recommend this phone."
418,5,I got the phone as a Christmas gift for my grandmother. It is a really pretty color compared to the other options. The screen is very vibrant! So far my grandmother hasnt has an issue learning to use it. The only problem is the thing is so freaking slippery! You will definitely need a case.
419,5,android is best. samsung makes it that way! the s8 is better than the s5!
420,4,"One of the best phone ever! The camera is awesome, even the front one."
421,5,Best Samsung phone I've had yet! Takes awesome pictures and has so much storage! Definitely! Satisfied customer!
422,5,This phone is quite fast. The features are amazing. I love the screen and the camera!
423,5,Samsung Galaxy 8 is a great phone. I get great reception and the pictures and videos are awesome.
424,4,"Nice phone. It's plenty fast enough to run most apps. The screen is crystal clear although It's difficult to find a good screen protector to fit the curved edges. It has plenty of space and it's easy to add an additional memory card for additional space. I haven't had to worry about the battery running out yet from a normal day of use, so the battery seems fine for the average user. That being said, if you stream movies and play games all day, you will need to recharge. Sound quality is good. All in all a great phone."
425,5,This is a great product. I would recommend this phone for anyone.
426,5,Best phone I ever owned. Fast. Beautiful display. Great phone signal and clarity. Small issue with an autocorrect that fills faster than I can respond but that is probably an operator issue.
427,5,"high quality, reliable phone, good service with Verizon and Best Buy"
428,5,"I was not disappointed. Great screen display, battery life, and camera."
429,4,Overall would have preferred a flat screen but processor and screen are good. Battery life is decent on this one soon far!
430,5,This phone is awesome! I upgraded from a Motorola Droid 2 and WOW the speed and capabilities (most of which I'm still discovering) GREAT PHONE
431,4,I upgraded to a Samsung galaxy 8 I really like the larger screen and camera
432,5,"Everything a phone should be. Clear images, large storage capacity and long battery life"
433,5,"Took a different sim card than my old phone had, even though I asked your staff if the sim cards were interchangeable and was told they were. But all data transferred and with a new sim card,,,beautiful phone."
434,5,We love this phone & it's so easy to use. Pictures are great.
435,5,Love the bigger screen & how simple it is to use. Great phone!
436,5,love the look and feel of the phone. battery is blah
437,5,"Great phone, love all the features. Samsung is an excellent product and would definitely recommend to anyone."
438,5,The best phone I have ever own super fast and smooth
439,5,soft and flexible making it easy to install / remove. good grip & control of phone.
440,5,I got the Samsung S 8 and I love it. I still have a lot to learn but I'm getting there. It's really a nice phone.
441,5,"Have had a Galaxy 3 and 6, so this was a logical choice. I especially like the ability to add a memory card, which you couldn't do on the s6. Loaded with nice features."
442,5,S8 is a great phone and I love all the features. Makes the things much simpler and easier.
443,5,A awesome phone in samsung family..looks good.easy to figure out features.crystal clear sound when making calls..perfect camera..
444,5,"I was very hesitant at buying this phone since I loooooved iPhones, but y'all let me tell you, BEST DECISION EVER. I got this thru Best Buy with my carrier for $300 off and it was too hard to resist the amazing quality for the price. If you're someone Who's willing to pay a thousand bucks for the iPhone x then be my guest, but for those of y'all who want quality, the s8 is definitely the way to go, it has so many options and it's so visually pleasing; it has yet to disappoint me. This phone is a 10/10 in my eyes."
445,4,"All around I find that this phone is good. However, due to the curved screen finding a good compatible tempered glass screen protector is difficult."
446,5,Everything that I was looking for in a phone is on this.
447,5,"Always a fan of the Galaxy models. Functionality, durability and easy operations along with great advances in common areas as logins and apps makes it the phone choice for me."
448,5,"Great phone, love the extra memory and camera is great also. Wish the Bixby worked better and until it is perfected it would be nice to be able to reprogram that stand alone button on the left instead of simply turning it off. You will not be disappointed with this phone!"
449,5,"Bought this for my wife as a big upgrade from the S3. Phone is very user friendly for someone that normally uses her phone for Facebook, emails and messaging. Camera is awesome and battery lasts all day."
450,5,"Most definitely my favorite of the Samsung Galaxy series phones. Simple to use and many more features/capabilities, whether I use all of them of not."
451,4,It's slick and innovative and I absolutely love it
452,4,Only concern is pretty average camera and also pushing Bixby down the users seems like a pretty bad move. It should have been an option instead of pushing it to the users.
453,2,"I did not go into Best Buy to buy a phone.I was looking for another product that you were out of. I walk past the phone display on my way out and a gentleman named Daniel came up to me and asked me if he could help. I was curious about the new phone a galaxy S8, and is started asking him questions. I told him I was not looking for a phone and he said that’s OK I’ll help you. So I asked him several questions, he very patiently answer them for me and I happened to notice a sign that said that there was a big discount if you bought the phone from Best Buy. I told him I would think about it I left and I came back the next day. The reason why I came back was because Daniel was so nice to me . He was very patient he was very knowledgeable he was friendly he knew his product and acted like I was the most important person in the store. That is why I bought the phone. Daniel is a huge asset to your Knoxville Tennessee store and I hope you gets the recognition that he deserves for this. Now on the other hand, the phone. The phone is ok, but I do not love the phone. I should have tried the camera more when I was in the store. I was able to go to a concert exactly two weeks after I bought the phone the pictures are Horrendous! I miss my galaxy S7 so much. Unfortunately it was past the 14 day return period. So I am now stuck with the phone that I really don’t like. Fortunately I still have my S7 and I am seriously considering going back to it. Then there is the problem with the video chat I think it’s called?. I can get every single person who has video chat on their phone to work except for my son. On my end the camera does not light up at all for me to even use it for him. And on his end it shows up that I cannot receive video chat calls. Unfortunately no one can fix it no one knows why. tech-support blames my sons phone which is with AT&T. My son and I went to AT&T and their tech-support blames my phone. Not happy with this situation. Both of us can video chat with other people on our respective phones but not with each other I would be a lot happier if that problem were fixed. For the price of that Phone I thought the camera would be so great ~~ extremely disappointed in the camera. Also extremely disappointed that I can’t talk to my son face-to-face we video chat. Wish I never would’ve bought the phone"
454,4,"I upgraded my Samsung from a S5 to a S8. So far it's a great phone, except don't care for the position of the buttons accessing Bixby."
455,5,This review is for the Nikon 200-500mm zoom lens. I had rented it several times prior to purchase. It is a great lens at a great price. The only negative is it is heavy.
456,5,Bought for my wife who replaced the S6. She loves the size and prefers it to her old S6.
457,5,"Everything about this phone is top notch. The screen, camera and overall speed are top notch."
458,5,"I love everything about this phone. The phone's speed, screen, and camera are all amazing."
459,5,The screen is very clear and the camera is superb. Lots of features.
460,4,I love the new phone. Great storage. My husband got one too.
461,5,my wife loves this phone and much cheaper at best buy than verizon
462,5,I've had the phone couple weeks and it far exceeds my expectations
463,5,Samsung phones just keep getting better and better. Awesome product.
464,3,Perfectly good phone however the curve screen makes it virtually impossible to find a screen protector that works correctly tried 5 different brands from the cheap to the rediculously expensive none of them are worth a hoot. Hope for the next version of S series phones has a flat screen
465,5,Best screen I've seen yet. Clear sound and very intuitive operations. Great deal at Thanksgiving.
466,5,I love my galaxy 8 so much better then my 5. I should have done it alot sooner.
467,5,The phone is great for pictures and all the apps. Delivery was fast and earlier than promised.
468,5,"great phone if you like samsung....the curved screen in my opinion doesn't really add that much, but the phone itself works great"
469,5,Great deals always at best buy especially on mobile phones!!!!
470,4,This is my 1st non iPhone. It seems great. Will take some getting use to. Plenty of memory. Plenty of features.
471,5,Great upgrade to my Samsung Galaxy S6. Love all the new features.
472,5,I loved all my Galaxy phones! This is just as great!
473,5,"Easy upgrade from S7, improved the functioning of Samsung Pay and use of the Gear S3 I have. Lost Samsung Pay Points when I reinstalled the Pay App but win some, lose some. Glad I got the. S8."
474,5,It is an easy phone to use and I love the fingerprint entrance.
475,5,I am very pleased with this phone. I will always stick with Samsung. Great product!
476,5,THIS PHONE IS THE RIGHT SIZE AND HAS ALL THE FEATURES YOU WILL NEED. I FOUND THE PHONE EASY TO USE AND THE DISPLAY CLEAR AND BRIGHT.
477,5,Bought this for my son to replace his old Galaxy. He absolutely loved his Samsung Galaxy and this is no exception.
478,5,I bought this for my hubby. Very pleased with the large screen and display. Easy to use.
479,5,Love the size and color of phone. It takes great pictures
480,4,Great so far. Good price and very nice customer service.
481,5,My son loved his Christmas gift he really like his phone
482,4,"Love the phone hate Bixby...it is a Siri wanna be, and Google assistant works just fine. And they've dedicated a button to which no one appears to be little figure out from reading on the Internet. How about a 1 button take a picture or bring back the home key"
483,5,"This phone works basically like the S6 I had before, just updated"
484,5,The phone is basically an updated version of what I had before
485,5,"Fast, dependable, long battery life. Good signal and big screen."
486,5,"It was time for an upgrade, so I went to my go to place to get my new phone. So far, I am very pleased, no complaints with my new Galaxy. Not to mention I got a discount!!"
487,5,Best Buy representative was very helpful... Great product knowledge.
488,5,Best phone I have owned to date. It's fast and easy to use. Amazing camera
489,5,Still learning all the capabilities of the phone. Super fast processor
490,5,"Had S6 which was on its way out so had to upgrade to S8. So far so good Runs much faster, better camera There is a 'back' button that was eliminated but it still appears virually on the screen which I actually like better - other sites found this to be a con"
491,5,This is a awesome phone A lot better then I thought it would be. It dose every thing plus
492,5,I love all the features this phone has to offer. Plus it was on sale with $300 off.
493,4,"I wasn't planning on buying a new phone, but my S5 just up and died on me, so I didn't have much choice. My husband and I have had Samsung phones for years, started with the S3, which I still listen to my ""sleep mix"" on every night. We then upgraded to the S5, and they've been great, until mine died. So, it really was a no brainer to stick with Samsung, and go to the S8. I haven't had much time to play with it yet, but so far I'm very happy. And it certainly didn't hurt that Best Buy had it on sale!"
494,5,"Beautiful camera quality. Fast. Bixby and Google are a great combination. Love the Samsung pay option. Very diverse, easy to change features to your liking."
495,4,Best galaxy so far battery life is great plus phone takes great pictures
496,5,Upgraded from galaxy note 4 to the new s8+. What a difference. Love the cameras on the s8+ and how fast the processor is comparably.
497,5,Has the edge on others cell. Nice and smooth screen. Beautiful display and sound.
498,5,This is a real nice phone I bought it for my wife for Christmas
499,4,No complaints so far with the phone itself. However I would have thought battery life would have been a little better. Also the menus aren't as straight forward as I would like so getting to and changing the settings to make the phone more usable is difficult. In addition there are a ton of apps that Samsung instantly installs on the phone that you have to get rid of so you don't have 5 pages of shortcuts to sort thru.
500,4,"I switched over from my Galaxy S6 to a Galaxy S8. I like that I have twice as much storage in the 64 gig. And I like that you can even upgrade this. I like that it is lighter than my S6 and actually has more viewing space. I'm still getting used to it and trying to figure it out. Tomorrow I am scheduled to take a 1/2 hour class over at my nearby Best Buy when how to best use the phone. I haven't really noticed any difference in the camera clarity. And the volume doesn't seem as loud as my S6. I will ask about this at the class tomorrow. I usually keep my phone for 3 years, but I started having some glitches with my S6, and had to keep deleting stuff because I kept running out of storage space. But I decided to switch now because they had a deal I couldn't refuse. I have the orchid Gray and it's quite pretty."
501,5,Love my new phone! Should have bought one earlier.
502,5,Love the galaxy 8. Won’t go back to an iPhone. Fast and more bang for your dollar.
503,5,"I love, love, love my new Galaxy S8! Samsung phones are just AWESOME. So many features. My first new phone since getting the S6 Edge 2 years ago. Samsung just keeps creating new features."
504,5,My son loves his new phone. He used to have apple. Finally made the switch.
505,5,I am a Samsung fan ... NOW I'm a Samsung/Best Buy fan! First time purchasing at Best Buy ... I'll be back!!!
506,5,"Bought for my son for Christmas. He had a Galaxy 6 edge, loves all the newest features."
507,5,We had looked at unlocked phones for a while.loves
508,5,I just recently upgraded from a galaxy s6 to this s8 and it is amazing. I love the full screen and the camera. Not too much of difference from the 6. I'm glad to have gotten this.
509,4,"She says it's too small, but I think she may be looking at it all wrong..."
510,5,"The best phone ever , My phone was broken and I went to look up for a phone and I came out with this wonderful device"
511,5,Bought this phone to replace my Samsung Notes 5. I like it better than the Notes5. It's a bit smaller and has updated functions and features.
512,5,Smart Switch was seamless to update from my Galaxy
513,5,Samsung is definitely living up to expectations. This phone has super technology and is water resistant/proof as well.
514,5,I love my new phone and the staff were pretty friendly.
515,5,"Just love my new phone.its very nice to look at,easy to use.takes great pics.very clear to see everything."
516,5,"I had a Samsung S6 and checked out the S8 when I was ready to upgrade. I love this phone, and the camera takes great photos. I really like the coral blue color, only available at Bet Buy."
517,5,"I always prefer Samsung over Apple. My new Galaxy S8 undoubtedly excelled all my expectations. Its style, infinity display, camera quality and battery life is absolutely amazing. I am really enjoying my new phone."
518,5,"I bought this phone for my teenage son, and he LOVES it. Built well. Amazing display.. Quick and responsive."
519,5,"I purchased the phone from Best Buy as a gift and received excellent, fast service. My husband loves the phone!"
520,5,S8 hands down the best Samsung phone to date. Leaps and bounds better than the S7.
521,5,Being a Galaxy owner previously I knew I could not go wrong. Held off for several years before making the new phone purchase plunge. Glad I did. Right fit for my needs.
522,5,"I like the new features and the size of this. It was hard deciding between this, and the 8+ for my son. Ultimately we went with this because he wanted something the felt good in his hand."
523,5,"The phone is great and the salesman Bradley was very knowledgeable and great people skills,. The galaxy 8 was a gift for my husband. The phone exceeds his expectations."
524,5,I have always been a Samsung user! I had to switch to an iPhone because it was free and couldn't wait to get back to Samsung! Love this phone!!
525,5,Absolutely love my new phone. Have had it for about 4 months now and have zero complaints.
526,5,Samsung has never disappointed me this is like my 4th Samsung galaxy and it keeps getting better and. Better
527,5,The Samsung Galaxies are a great phone to have. I love my S8!
528,5,My wife and I just upgraded out phones and we couldn't be happier
529,5,As someone that has an Ipnone since they came out this was my first travel to the dark side! I found this phone to be easy to use and simple to navigate! I will definitely buy another one when this one gets traded in!
530,5,Phone has very good features and it has very good camera.
531,5,MY SON WAS LONG OVERDUE FOR A NEW PHONE. MORE MEMORY. BETTER SECURITY FEATURES. HE LOVED IT.
532,5,I like that it is blue and shiny and I got a clear case for it so people can see it's blue
533,5,"I don't usually purchase the most popular items, but i backed myself into this Samsung phone and I've been really really pleased with it"
534,5,"Bought this phone for family in Ireland and saved them about $200 by getting it on sale. It was a much better deal than they could get there. Once they got it and plugged in a SIM card from Ireland, it worked perfectly. They needed a simple adaptor for the charger, but everything was easy and worked great. They are very happy with it,"
535,4,"I upgraded my S6 to this phone and am very happy. I had hoped that the battery would last longer than it does, but I love everything else about the phone. I read some criticism about the finger print ID scanner being on the back, but I haven't used it yet. I use the iris scanner for my eyes and it works faster than the finger scanner did. Even in the dark."
536,4,"Lots of great features. The ""edgeless"" screen was strange at first, but after a couple of days, it's great."
537,5,This phone is great and has the best camera ever. Im not tech savy but i figured this phone out rather quickly.
538,5,"Upgraded from S6 to Galaxy S8. Nice phone, great camera (front and rear), and I like the edge panel. Most glass screen protectors I tried seem to take away from touch sensitivity so had to go with film protector. Great phone though!!!"
539,5,Better size and brighter screen than my old S6. Camera has better quality pictures and detail. Improved battery life so far.
540,5,Brought this phone for my son and he loves it. States it is better than the droid he was using
541,5,"Wife switched to Galaxy 8, previously had an Apple SE."
542,4,"I bought this phone due to the deal BestBuy had at the time ($300 off). I upgraded from Galaxy S4 (!!). Most data/apps/etc. transferred but not all. Also, some features are different, but that is the price of technology advancing."
543,4,Best present my father got for christmas. He went for s6 to the s8. He love it.
544,4,"The S8 came with necessary adaptors to easily transfer from my previous S6. Plugged the two phones together and everything copied automatically. Also includes a microUSB to Type C adaptor so you can use your old cables to charge. The phone is responsive, excellent screen, upgradeable memory and worthy upgrade from earlier Samsung phones."
545,5,It's Great phone. So glad we upgraded from the S7.
546,5,"I have only had the S8 for a short time, but it is so much nicer than the Droid Turbo it replaced. Fast camera and the images are really nice. Plus got a great deal at Best Buy. WAY LESS than the Verizon store."
547,5,Bought the S8 as a Christmas present for my 17 year old daughter and she loves it.
548,4,"The latest in Samsung's Galaxy S series, it continues to amaze."
549,4,"The phone works fine. The curved screen is nice. I don't like that it uses a different charge cord than the S7. It does come with an adapter for the S7 cord, but you have to have that of you just have the common cord. If you charge wirelessly there is no change to charging."
550,5,Great Christmas deal on this phone. I only purchased it because of the sale.
551,5,"I've been quite happy with the Galaxy S8. I love the large screen, and it has great resolution. This is a great device for watching media. Battery lasts all day!"
552,5,"I prefer Samsung products over the over priced ""fruit"" brand. Good pictures."
553,5,"Expected the changeover on Christmas to take hours and be a big inconvenience. However, a quick call to Verizon (surprise) and the phone had its SIM card in and making calls. Besides some quirks on importing calendars, the only thing missing was the ""smart alarm."" Like the edge display and size."
554,4,"Christmas present for my daughter...her 1st phone. She really likes it, she's 13. No complaints so far!"
555,5,love samsung products - my whole family has a Galaxy phone love them
556,5,"Light years better than my previous phone, which was admittedly five years old and therefore ancient. Easy to use, takes nice pictures, and great battery life. After a month of use, I have no complaints."
557,3,This thing is so fragile. Even the back is made of glass and has already cracked. Keep in mind I upgraded from an S5 that I have had forever with no breakage. Also the rounded corners and sides make the touchscreen difficult to use because you are always accidentally pushing or selecting something just by holding it.
558,4,"REplaced my S4 with S8. Easy transition except my memos didn't transfer so had to do it manually. Spent a lot of time turning off, deleting much of the bloatware. If you don't do this then battery life is not very good."
559,5,Just upgraded from the S4. WOW what a great upgrade! Unbelievable how far technology has reached in just a few years. All the bells and whistles and then some. Camara takes very good pics. Just starting to learn about all the new features but seems amazing.
560,1,"Takes excellent pictures!! BUT, sometimes hearing a caller is difficult as it sounds very muffled. Really thought since it was the ""new and improved"" it would be a whole lot better than that!"
561,5,All around great phone. Fast both on wifi and on network. Biometrics work better than I would have expected.
562,5,Fast both on wifi and on network. Biometrics work better than I would have expected. All around great phone
563,5,absolutely love this Galaxy S8. Fast both on wifi and on network. Biometrics work better than I would have expected.
564,5,"Decent price for a very good tablet...better than the likes and prices of IPads. The tab is fast, light weight and has expandable storage memory. Samsung Switch worked well to port over data from other Android device."
565,5,This is one of 3 galaxy s8 phones that I have purchased. We all love these phones. The camera is fantastic.
566,5,"I am not a tech savvy dude. My old smartphone was 4 years old and was taking a few minutes to turn on and I was replacing the battery every 3 months so it was time for a new phone. I was worried that my lack of knowledge and fat fingers were going to be my downfall. I was going for something cheap figuring as that I would drop the new phone into the outhouse or I would just plain lose it. I checked everywhere and then noticed Best Buy had it on sale for 1/2 price, which was about 15.00 a month for 24 months through Verizon. This was 3 days after Black Friday. The S8 is way easy to operate, the battery life is days improved from the last one and it syncs with the Bluetooth in my car immediately. At this point in time I am really happy with it. It claims to be water resistant but I also purchased a water resistance cover for it just in case.The cover makes it sound like I have a cold but I put it on speaker phone and it works great."
567,4,"Love the camera on the phone, super thin - miss some old features the s5 had on it though"
568,2,"Due to raised curved screen, ZAGG cover does not stay on. Phone slid off the couch onto the floor day 1 and ZAGG popped off shattering glass. Screen does not respond to swipe. It takes 5-6 swipes to get response and battery runs down really quickly. One day and battery is dead. I DON'T play games, watch videos etc. I only talk and text so there should be no reason for dead battery. I would not purchase it again."
569,5,"It was time for an upgrade, I purchased it on cyber Monday and saved a bit of cash. no issues with set up, swapped out sim card from old S6 phone and into the new one."
570,4,"Working without any bugs. Great pictures, hooked up quickly to my Wi-Fi. Only complaint is small keyboard and inability to use glass cover."
571,5,We love Samsung products. Bought 3 Note8 and this S8 at the same time for my son. Phones work great. This S8 is just slightly shorter than Note 8 so it was a nice size to put inside the pocket according to my son. We always trust Samsung.
572,5,"Upgraded to the 8S. Looks great, plenty of memory too. Still trying to get used to the screen going to the edges."
573,5,"This phone was for me and I love it.My wife was not impressed with hers.Camera was a huge upgrade from the s5 I had.Professional quality to me and easy to use.the phone has a perfect picture,Has to set phone sound under advanced to get rid of high pitch ,but i was able to change it,so complaints really.Dont worry about the color because I think any case will cover it"
574,4,this phone was for my wife.her view is that its not that much of a upgrade from the s5 she had.The s-beam is no longer a built in feature and everything needs to be set up in one way or another.I call it customizing.The camera is a huge upgrade though.it the best feature considering we have a 1yr old.
575,5,"love the camera, love that is water proof so I didn't have to spend a lot of money on case"
576,5,Upgraded from an iphone 4S and I absolutely love this phone. The screen and edge is amazing. Coming from Apple it took me a little bit to get used to.. but for me I am much happier with the Samsung. I prefer the Apple Store selection but overall very happy with this purchase. I had Best Buy install a screen protector and upgrade my account and they had me out very quickly. A+ service.
577,5,"I purchased the Samsung Note 8 for a hefty price and I had high expectations for it that I thought it would never be able to live up to. Boy was I wrong! This phone has blown me away and all the anxiety I had paying such a high price seems laughable. This phone is the best phone in the market, in my opinion. Buy without any apprehensions, you will not be disappointed."
578,4,"Wanted an upgrade from the Note 5 and no longer wanted the features of the Note, especially with the unreasonable price so went with the S8. Has been a good phone although have only used it for a month. Does more than I need and came at a good price."
579,5,So far so good with the latest Samsung Galaxy phone.
580,5,I love the face recognition and finger print reader
581,5,Phone does everything you could possibly ask it to do
582,5,Have not updated my cell phone for a while. Brought this unlocked phone on a sale. Really like this phone a lot!!
583,5,Had the phone for 2 weeks and love it. Battery is amazing and all the updates are great.
584,5,I recommend this phone and I can use when I travel too is fabulous
585,1,I always love samsung but the thing I didn't like its that they made all the phones edge they break easy it cost more to replace it or fix it then buy a new one deductible its like 250 hope they start making them square or other shapes but not edge not my thing.
586,5,I got this phone on a thanksgiving deal. It’s been brilliant in all aspects and the screen continues to impress me with its features! Definitely a good buy.
587,5,"Quite the upgrade from the S4, no complaints whatsoever"
588,5,"I love the new look of the S8 and the battery life is way better than my S7. Functionality is comparable just in a sleeker design. Camera is better than the S7. The absence of the home and back button really is not a big deal as it's now part of the touchscreen. So far, I'm very happy with it!"
589,5,Love the battery life. Love the new charging port.
590,4,"good phone and good features, infinite display and camera quality's are good.."
591,4,Always had great luck with Samsung products. This is a gift for my son. I expect great things from this product.
592,5,I had used a Samsung S6 phone for 2 years and recently upgraded to Samsung S8 phone. I like the product; has plenty of new features.
593,4,"I like the phone specs, just wish it was a little wider. A good screen protector is hard to find for this phone. A little too pricey even with the black friday ""special."" Otherwise I have had no issues with the phone. Has a very fast processor."
594,5,I bought the cell phone for my son and he really like it.
595,5,I love the free things that came with it I enjoy getting good deals
596,4,"Obviously the screen is great, camera takes nice photos too. I also like the iris scan for security. I wear contacts, did not take them out to ""register"" my iris and regardless of whether or not I have them in, the phone quickly recognizes me and opens. It's not able to with glasses, but just take them off pre-scan. I rarely wear glasses so it's not a big deal for me. I like Bixby, it can do all kinds of things but i don't care for the button placement on the phone or for the fact that I have to hold it down the whole time while giving instructions. I wish it would start taking commands from a single press. Battery life isn't great - I have to charge every evening as soon as I get home. Overall, I like the galaxy S8. Mine is an unlocked phone, so I can use it with any carrier I want and it didn't come preloaded with a bunch of worthless apps."
597,5,Love my phone so far! It holds the battery life well and has some cool new features.
598,4,"it seems to be very functionable,light weight and really nice"
599,3,"Samsung has ""improved"" their Galaxy phones with the S8 and the edge to edge screen, but it is difficult to find a screen protector that will stay on at the curved edges. Also difficult to select area along the curved edges. Samsung wants to wow you with extraneous features but does not take the time to ensure that basic phone features work as expected. How much money did Samsung spend to develop the worthless Bixby to try to compete with Siri while my finger or stylus rolls off the curved edge of the screen?"
600,5,Great Product and as advertised! Fast Shipping!!
601,5,I consider this phone one of the best. The design with the edge screen is awesome. There are too many great features to mention. Love the long-life battery. I usually get a day and 1/2 out of the battery. The latest Oreo OS system is coming soon also.
602,5,This is a very well constructed phone. The display is gorgeous in the functionality is as good as any phone on the market. Samsung has blended in android beautifully on this phone to make them work seamlessly together.
603,5,"Galaxy S8. Great wifi charging, screen quality, controlling so many wifi products in the home. Get one."
604,5,I love this phone works very well for me does everything I could ask for
605,5,"I've been a loyal Samsung S customer for years so I immediately purchased this phone during the Black Friday sale, lowest price I saw so far. The battery lasts much longer than the S6 edge, the index finger security option is very convenient for on the go, and I love the orchid gray color! I will continue to be a Samsung phone customer for years to come!"
606,4,"I like the color of my new product , it makes it easier to fine in my purse. would recommend it a friend."
607,3,Do not like the edge on the screen and much different than the Galaxy 6 I had prior.
608,4,"I'll put 5 stars to this phone, since the specs are basically the same as the bigger one, except that at the first fall from my pocket now it's has a lot of scratch in a black phone doesn't look so nice, and the screen also has a small scratch, so you will have to spend more money on a case, on the other hand my Pixel doesn't have any scratches and this one had many falls in the hands of a toddler with no case. Other than that is a great phone at an excellent price."
609,5,best phone from samsung yet. camera is by far superior to any phone ever.
610,5,Love my new Galaxy S8. My first smart phone. Learn something new about every day.
611,5,"Great size screen, the time and date display along the edge of screen is an excellent feature."
612,5,Worked really well international and in the us. Camera works great
613,5,"I've always used Samsung products whether phones, appliances or electronics and never had any problems with the brand. I had a Samsung S4 phone before I purchased the S8 and it still works just fine. Got a new phone just because..."
614,5,I am sorry for all of the iPhone users that spend too much on a mediocre product.
615,5,Ease of use after training. Takes great pictures. Fast charging capability.
616,4,"As a longtime Samsung customer, it was an easy choice to upgrade to the S8. The graphics are a step up from my S5 but it is the better battery and bigger storage that really make the difference in my day to day thusfar."
617,5,"Excellent phone, ease of using, the camera is excellent quality."
618,4,I haven't had the phone to long. It seems to be doing good. There is quite a few functions to the S8 that I have yet to learn how to use. Overall I think it is a good phone.
619,5,"Purchasing this phone just solidifies what I knew all along. There is just way too much hype with iPhones. Samsung and Android deliver a 1-2 punch that K.O.'s all the other competition. My S8 is fast, durable, reliable and more than smart, it's downright genius."
620,4,"Great phone, delivery was fine but the curved screen is a nightmare if you like to use screen protectors to safeguard your investment. None of the glass ones work well and they will crack easily on the curve if hit. PET ones fit good but don't offer the protection of tempered glass. Just beware."
621,3,They changed the charger port on this one. My only gripe so far.
622,5,Great functionality especially after leaving iPhone.
623,5,"This phone is all the promotion says it is. It is easy to use, has great camera, and easy to use applications."
624,3,The other things are perfect but my only issue is regarding to the battery performance and it's not as I saw from the reviews and some YouTubes
625,5,Upgraded my wife's phone and she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and customize to her liking.
626,5,Slimmer design and easy to transfer all the data from my old phone. Works wonderful so far!
627,5,"Absolutely love my new phone! The phone is a bit narrower than the 7 Edge (which I prefer), but overall just a great product"
628,5,One of the best phones I have had so far. Camera is not as good as others like pixel
629,5,"Initially I don't like the size of the phone .when I had cover on it,I can feel good in my hands.no lagging,unlock with finger print scanner is not that fast.nice design.if you really looking for a good phone go for it.you have other option too ,wait for a month Samsung may release next version of it's Galaxy series"
630,5,Great phone. Easy to use. Awesome camera. Lots of great features.
631,5,"My Galaxy S7 screen cracked and I decided to get the S8 since the deal was so good. My monthly payments dropped in half due to the Black Friday discount. I am a long-time Galaxy phone user. So, I will only compare this phone to my previous ones. It's slightly larger and clearer. It's extremely fast and the battery lasts all day. I have also doubled my memory from 32gb to 64gb. Moving my data took some time because the rep used her phone as the mifi and store wifi was too slow, the transfer took over an hour. Also all of my music did not make it. I went home, erased the data, and reloaded the music on my home wifi and it took less than 5 minutes. So, I recommend that you do it on your own. It's very easy to do. Overall a great phone. After having had preset buttons, this phone has taken some getting used to with the screen mode for them. Also, I prefer the Google launcher and switched to the Samsung one. My one gripe is that the phone seems a little less touch sensitive and I have to sometimes swipe down several times to get the menu shortcuts to activate features. I would rate this phone at about a 4.8 but I am rounding up to 5 stars. All that said, I would recommend this phone after using it a month."
632,5,"It doesn't get much better than this with phones. This is consumer reports number one phone of 2017. Could do without Bixby, for sure."
633,5,Great phone fast 64gb One month ago no issues so far ..I recommend it
634,5,This phone has lots of great features and is easy to use. It take great pictures and can understand what it sees.
635,5,"Easy to use, lots of storage, and long lasting battery."
636,4,Very slim and delicate piece. Easy to operate and handy.
637,4,best but was great for my phone Samsung is terrible for custumer service
638,5,"I love it, very light weight and easy to work. Happy"
639,5,I traded in my Samsung S III for this lovely blue S 8 and know i traded up. There's much better control over many functions from the lighted screen to the fantastic 12mp camera. Apps work much faster (thank goodness). My friend no longer complains when i talk to her on my mobile.
640,5,A battery that lasts all day and plenty of storage space. Couldn't ask for more.
641,5,was using an S7 Edge when I decided to upgrade to this phone. The screen is just fantastic and love the camera!
642,5,I found this phone easy to operate and fast to process
643,4,"The phone is wonderful in all aspects of performance that you expect from a flagship phone, but Bixby. Same gripe of dedicated side button that cannot be used for anything but Bixby."
644,4,Good phone. Not sure if there is a voice pickup problem.
645,5,Love the result of the camera. Long lasting battery.
646,5,Love this Samsung galaxy S8 LTE! I have never purchased an unlocked phone before . It was very easy to set up with my provider . I am still learning all the great things I can do with this phone . Very happy with it ..
647,4,"I was debating between a Google Pixel 2 or the Galaxy S8, and I chose the S8 since Best Buy had a great deal on it. I'm not disappointed. I love the camera the most; the pictures are bright and clear and capture my kids' activities very nicely. A couple things I don't care for - the inability to delete all the pre-installed apps and the edge screen is easily triggered accidentally. Other than those minor things, I'm very happy with my purchase."
648,4,Good service on line quick delivery and good product choices. Easy user friendly sight and great price.
649,5,Very much an upgrade from my old phone. Easy to use with convenience features that are very clever.
650,4,"I admit, I'm a Samsung/Android fan. I own an iPad only because it was forced on me. It has its uses. But my S8 takes awesome pictures, links every time to my car sound system, It got the 4 stars due to the whole Bixby thing. I hate being forced to use something I don't want."
651,5,First I bought myself a phone then i bought my wife one.
652,5,This is the best phone around. I love the size speed and battery life.
653,5,"Great phone, excellent camera, and easy to use. Love it!"
654,5,"After having an iPhone for the last 5 years, I was a bit nervous to switch over. It took about 5 hours of phone use to really start learning the new OS and now, about 2 weeks later, it feels like second nature. I love the galaxy. It is so much better than the iPhone. In recent headlines about Apple being sued for slowing down iPhones, I think now is the perfect time to switch to a company that does not do that. I do miss iMessage, FaceTime, and a good camera while using Snapchat. But besides those 3 things, there has been nothing that I miss from the iPhone. Make the switch. You won't regret it. If you do actually regret it, you do have 2 weeks to return the phone to bestbuy and only need to pay a $30 restocking fee. But I am sure you will like it."
655,5,"More memory, faster speed, nice size al in all a great upgrade"
656,5,I'm glad I didn't get the S8 plus. This size is perfect for my hands. Feels great with my Otter box Defendor case
657,4,This was a gift for my wife. Switching from IPhone. It is taking her a while to get used to it. She LOVES the pictures.
658,5,I love the galaxy s8 and was a great deal on cyber Monday. Highly recommended.
659,5,We previous owned a pair of j7's and these phones are a little better. They are fast and have a great screen. I am very pleased with the purchase overall. The only negative I have found is that the speech recognition does not work as well as our J7's or the S5's before them.
660,5,"This cell is faster, the camara is the best.All is working well.I am very happy with it."
661,5,"The best android phone, the great smart phone, best choice"
662,5,It is an excellent phone. It has an amazing resolution and photo and video quality. The size is perfect. I absolutely recommend this product a 100%
663,5,My daughter and I love this phone. The camera is the best one yet.
664,5,I liked the phone very much just loved it its amazing
665,5,Best deal and best phone. This time your price beat Costco price.
666,5,"Great customer service, great products! I've only had for about a month but so far, we are satisfied."
667,5,"I like the features on this phone, still able to use an SD card, even with 64 memory. Nice battery life. Lots of options. I used to be able to carry extra batteries with my old S5 for a quick change out. Hope I don't need that with this quick charge phone."
668,5,"works great, runs great. Awesome camera. slight drawback is the speaker. it only has one at the bottom and it's not the loudest. phone comes with headphones so as long as you remember to carry those around it's all good."
669,3,Great price for the latest top line Samsung phone. Provides good Android functionality with the most commonly used apps. Light and easy to hold. Downsides: battery life is deficient with even moderate use; phone has trouble syncing with fitbit wearable tech - a problem Fitbit tech support has not yet fixed.
670,4,"This phone is a nice phone, but it has a lot of updates that mess with the phone, and shuts down some apps and wi-fi"
671,5,I love this phone. It is fast and very user friendly.
672,4,Much faster then the S6 I had and better graphics as well
673,5,Good phone. Easy to learn and customize. Another great Samsung product.
674,5,"The Galaxy S8 is a great phone with much improved battery life and vastly increased internal memory. It works a lot like other Galaxys. But the speech feature still needs work. 0ne word of advice: do not establish facial recognition as a security measure. It doesn't work in dark conditions and can be a problem at other times. Instead, establish a pin. Verizon put through a software update that rendered the facial recognition unusable and effectively locked me out of my screen. It took hours on the phone to get this fixed. So, best advice is to not do it."
675,5,Great phone at a good price. Very happy with it and functions better than my iphone
676,5,I really like my headphone and it is so good. Nice sound
677,5,Very nice phone. I had the S7 edge and this upgrade is definitely better.
678,5,I replaced a Galaxy 4 with version 8. It was on sale with about half off. The screen is about as large as I can carry in my pocket and the resolution is phenomenal. Speed is much better than the 4. It has many options that let me configure it like I want it. Pictures are amazing.
679,5,Samsung is a great phone. I replaced the samsung s6 I had with this one. I went back to samsung 2 1/2 years ago because I didn't like the way the Iphone system works.
680,5,I went from the iPhone to the S8. Love the camera.
681,5,Camera is great. Apps are easy to load. Battery life is efficient.
682,4,The s8 is a good phone but I wouldn't consider it great. Although I would still put it above iPhone I'm not to crazy about the edge display myself but this was my first phone with having it.
683,5,Upgraded from Galaxy S6 and continue to find the Samsung Galaxy line excellent to the point that I use my laptop much less including when travelling.
684,5,"I bought this phone to see if it can make me move away from iPhone, and I am so happy to have made the decision to move. The S8 has great screen, good battery life and very nice size (fits well in my pocket and hand). I would strongly recommend this phone to anyone who is on the fence for moving away from iPhone."
685,1,Spent $644.00 on a new s8 phone. But was not allowed to receive later promotion of 100 e gift and remote charger. Good by Best Buy. Would not recommend these people.
686,4,"The phone works well, fast and haven't had any trouble with it. I like the internal space it has, no more problems with not being a be to download apps because of space."
687,5,"I have both Apple and Samsung products, this by far is my favorite so far. All the features are great and the phone looks amazing!"
688,5,This phone is amazing! I truly love it and I loovve the camera and everything it does!
689,5,"I have the same phone from my employer. I use it with a eauto service app.Had the 6 before this 8.Got use to how everything works. Vary satisfied with this phone.My wife has I7 apple,Hate it compared to galaxy 8."
690,5,This is the third Samsung I've had over the last 5 years. I have had great success with them all and no problems.
691,5,Have just gotten this phone and it was easy to set up. Love it so far.
692,5,I brought this phone for my daughter and she loves it.
693,5,This is my first unlock phone and I love everything about it.
694,5,Love how fast it is and how clear the pics are. Great phone
695,5,"Better camera than previous model, slicker design, water resistant is a good feature."
696,5,Love how fast it is. I also love the camera and how big the screen is
697,5,"Bought it for my wife, she likes it very much. Nice!"
698,5,"purchased from best buy, had the best price,love it"
699,5,"This is the best phone out there right now. The phone is beautiful and fast. It does everything better than the iPhone. Got the unlocked version, no bloatwares, get to add my own apps. No stupid upgrades and than another upgrade to fix an upgrade."
700,5,Great phone but I wish it came with qi wireless charger I had to buy i t separatly. But the phone is great
701,1,"Hate, hate, hate this phone! The keyboard is terrible. The apps don't work as my old 4, they are worse. The curve makes it difficult to use many functions"
702,4,Overall this phone is great. Takes a very good pics
703,5,"Love my phone and so happy I gave in to get a new one. My old Galaxy 4 was giving me so many problems but I was afraid I would have a problem getting use to a new phone and all the new apps. I was wrong, it was so easy to get use to. Pictures are beautiful, love the camera. The saleman was so good and helpful with all my questions which really helped me out."
704,5,Bought this for my bf n he loves it. It’s very sleek. Quality is excellent.
705,5,Wonderful looking device with a great display and good battery life. Easily usable with 1 hand.
706,5,"This phone does everything it's advertised to do, and then some. It takes amazing photos, also, I'm still learning the details it has to offer."
707,5,My Daughter love her new phone!! We always buy our phones at best buy!!!
708,5,"Great phone, light weight, love the curved screen, processor is quick"
709,5,I'm android loyal so this s8 is exactly what I wanted for my phone upgrade.
710,5,"Installation was easy for my son, up and running in 15 minutes"
711,5,"Easy to install, easy to use. Best Buy Verizon rep very knowledgeable and easy to work with"
712,5,Finally upgraded phones and this one was on sale. Fantastic qualities. Great battery life. Great camera. And it's fast!
713,5,One of the best devices . Even better than the iPhone x. Camera is great but is kind of small
714,4,"I decided to upgrade to a Galaxy S8 when it went on sale Black Friday weekend because my S5 battery was going out fast. I love the phone, it has many upgrades over the S5, but I am a little disappointed with battery life. I still can't get though a day without having to put it on a charger. I do use it a lot and have many applications (I use it for work) but I expected longer battery life. Other than that, the phone is really great. Don't buy Apple, get a phone that can have expandable memory (micro SD card) it makes life a lot better. The only other complaint I have with the phone is that Samsung phones no longer have a removable battery, so no hard booting. Am hoping that this doesn't prove to be a problem. It was nice to have that feature (plus the ability to replace the battery if needed) The phone itself is a nice upgrade and feels like it is made of quality materials."
715,5,"There is a learning curve, but it is worth the effort!"
716,5,Got this as my husband's upgrade. He enjoys it. The only complaint I've heard is the swipe texting isn't good.
717,4,I brought a couple of my friends to Best Buy and both of them bought phones one of them bought a Galaxy 8 and the other one got a Galaxy 8 Edge
718,5,"buying experience was easy, delivery sooner that we expected/ Love the phone. There is so much to learn about the phone but instructions are readily available and easy to understand"
719,5,Love the apps and how easy it is to use. Samsung camera and options are also a plus. Great phone overall !
720,4,I like this phone so much I brought a couple of people to Best Buy to purchase one and they're very satisfied customers
721,5,Great phone. No issues. Good battery and best phone I have
722,5,I bought this phone for a family member and it has gotten great review so far
723,5,Where a good quality product and much longer better live than previous versions
724,5,The Samsung 8 is a great phone. Like how the charger can be plugged in either way to the phone.
725,5,Love it it's easy to use and I like the ease of use.
726,5,"S8 is very compatible with my professional and personal needs. Great for relaxtion with variety of options for audio, visual and games."
727,5,"Sleek design, not a heavy phone, always loved Samsung"
728,3,Upgraded due to experiencing problems with current Galaxy phone.
729,5,Great phone for the storage and price. Would definitely recommend.
730,5,Like the finger print and cameras. Great display. Like hidden home screen buttons.
731,5,Love this phone. I upgraded my 6s edge to this. The camera is excellent. Take great vivid photos.
732,3,"were all deal breakers for me. While there's a lot to like about this phone, I couldn't get a screen protector to stay on it. The speed of the phone wasn't much better than my 1.5 year old Moto G4+. Before you shell out big bucks for a high end phone, you should check out what's available in the mid-range. My G4+ has a cleaner Android experience. So I returned the S8 and went back to my Moto G4+ and am glad I did. I couldn't have been happier with the Everett, MA staff for their support during the sale AND in the return process. They were knowledgeable, competent and handled the return without a hassle."
733,5,Not to large and not to small Just a real good phone
734,5,back to android after a brief visit to the iphone world
735,5,I'm a fan of the Samsung products. Beautiful!!!!!!

739,5,It is a great purchase. I love how it functions... the best that I've ever purchased
740,4,Great phone. Takes really good pictures and the full screen size is a really nice bonus.
741,5,Bought for my son as a present. His old Samsung was dropped a few times and the screen cracked right away. This one has been dropped but the screen seems more durable.
742,5,"The phone like most Galaxy's have been very well made and each upgrade add's some more features, more internal memory, water resistance, memory card slot, faster processor (the heart of these devices)"
743,5,This phone was worth the money due to its great technology and fair price.
744,5,The phone like most Galaxy's have been very well made and each upgrade add's some more features.
745,5,Traded an S6 in for this. It's been great so far. Fast. Nice screen.

751,5,I really like this product and the service I received was excellent
752,5,"Love the features and battery power,color and size."

755,5,"Love this phone, it is fast, slim, full of options, and was a breeze to set up."
756,5,"Samsung has so many features, there is no way to know how to do all that the phone can do. But it is simple enough to do all that I can dream of to do."
757,5,"Have had it for two weeks now, so far I love it. The screen is crazy crystal clear, the camera is by far the best I've ever used, go buy one, you'll fall In love with it!"
758,5,I upgraded my Samsung Galaxy to this model. It is very easy to use and didn't need to spend a lot of time learning specifics of the phone. Takes great photos
759,5,Satisfied with my new phone customer service was great
760,4,"Phone works. As it should for the money you pay. I prefer a more durable phone, opposed to thin, light, & fragile."
761,4,"So far it has been a great phone. Extensive memory, beautiful pictures, and has high end applications others higher priced phones have. Worth it. Samsung makes an excellent product. Had IPhone, then bought Samsung the past few times."
762,5,This phone is great for beginners and experts. Very user friendly has many options
763,5,Awesome phone. Super fast. Great screen. Good signal strength. Iris scanner and fingerprint scanner work great
764,5,Curved screen is the best feature of this phone. This is the best samsung phone till now.
765,5,Samsung 8 is a winner. Big changes from my Samsung 6. I was a little annoyed that my old chargers would no longer work with the 8 but was told that it is a big improvement when transferring.
766,5,"My last phone was a Galaxy S4 and it has been a great phone. I looked at the S8 because it had all the features I wanted. Edge to Edge Screen, Bixby, Finger Print security and an excellent camera."
767,4,"It is difficult to touch the farthest keys on board, 1,0, q, p. It fits much better in my hand than Samsung S6. Added security is nice."
768,1,Phone became useless after a 2 foot drop do not buy extremely fragile and now getting the run around to get it fixed
769,5,I bought the phone as a gift and my boyfriend loves it.
770,4,Good quality item. Easy to install. Is very durable.
771,4,Like the new Galaxy S8. Has mice features not available on our old S6.
772,5,I finally convinced my mom to upgrade from a Samasung S4 Mini to the Galaxy S8. She actually loves the phone.
773,4,I really like this phone. The camera is awesome and the features are great! The only thing I'm so-so on is how the screen curves and I have a little more trouble texting. But I really enjoy this phone.
774,5,"Samsung has always been on the cutting edge, I love everything about this phone. My overall review about this product, I would give it a 100 plus and 2 thumbs up!!!!!"
775,4,Very nice phone. Nice apps like Samsung pay. Only negatives are the Bixby search engine doesn't match up to Google's and the finger recognition is finicky and unreliable. Otherwise an all around great phone that fits beautifully in the hand.
776,5,Switched back from an iphone to the new samsung. So far so good. Much more solid feel than previous models
777,4,I like how easy it is to use the phone and get to settings.
778,5,"Purchased this item as a gift for a friend. The intuitive screen is very user-friendly. The screen has a very pleasant sensation when touched and responds quickly. Love the phone's sleek, slim design. This is a perfect smart phone."
779,5,Decided to buy the S8 Samsung phone over the larger S8+. Love the size and the edge glass. The S8 fits smoothly in my back pocket without worrying it will fall out.
780,4,This phone is a new phone my wife got to replace her iPhone 5S. The new large screen is great and the design is also. The 'Edge' style makes finding a protective case difficult and the fingerprint sensor on the back is too small and in a weird location (next to camera). My wife also has great difficulty getting the fingerprint to read and the screen is not very responsive to her touch. It took some getting used to on the switch from IOS to Android but she is getting used to it.
781,5,"Takes some getting used to (switched from a different brand), but I do love the sleek design, the features and it's fast processor"
782,5,I have galaxy 6edge and is great and now i have this galaxy S8 excited to use it so far its great size and the color is nice.
783,5,Nice upgrade price . Great display and battery life. Lots of options too
784,5,The Galaxy S8 is an awesome phone for the price. Beautiful screen. Feels good in hand. Good battery life.
785,5,"So far with having this phone, I love it. It has more features than my S6. I love how it looks more clearer and I can do and access so much more."
786,5,"I have been using galaxy phones for a while. S3, S5, S7 edge and now S8. S8 has the best camera i have seen in a while on phones and feels sleeker and easy to use with one hand than s7 edge. Love the end to end screen and expanded internal memory."
787,5,"Even better than the s6. Don't like the first screen with the split digital clock, hopefully will find way to change."
788,5,"Like everything except the front screen, have not figured out how to change on front screen"
789,5,"Pros: Fast processor Customizable menus, icons, ect. Sleek design. Clear call quality. Amazing display. Expandable storage via micro USB. Great camera. Cons: Fingerprint scan placement is awkward. The curved glass makes it difficult to find a screen protector that fits and functions well. Overall, I absolutely love this phone. One of the best phones I have ever owned."
790,5,It's a great phone with excellent screen resolution
791,4,"This is a great phone, I have always been an android user but this new one has so many new features I am still trying to figure them out. Great camera, usability and the fast charge it awesome."
792,3,"We needed a new phone, have the S7, and don't love the narrower size of the S8, or the rounded edges, I feel like the screen is much more vulnerable and don't like that they took away the manual home button! I see Apple did the same, but my fingers are dry and smooth and with a screen protector have trouble with touch screen responsiveness! I like my S7 better, giving this to my daughter, which I might regret if it gets lost, stolen or broken!!!!"
793,4,Phone’s display is outstanding. Performance is very impressive.
794,5,Great Android phone. The speed and screen quality are top notch. I have no issues with this phone.
795,5,"The battery life is so much better than expected, call clarity is wonderful & I have no complaints. We have 4 samsung phones and truly love this model."
796,5,Fast and user friendly. S8 is by far the best phone on the market
797,4,"I know you can download instructional material, but you need basic instructions to be able to activate the needed apps."
798,5,Told of the line phone. Samsung has done it Again.
799,5,It has been a couple of weeks. So far I love the phone and its many uses.
800,5,"Excellent product, great service. Would recommend to a friend"
801,5,"After waiting over 3 months to get my new phone, I was very pleased with this one. It is more than I expected and I'm more than satisfied with my choice."
802,4,Purchased online and picked up in store. Purchased as a gift.
803,5,So far it's been a great phone. Good battery life and fits perfectly in my hand. Also works well with wireless fast charger. Lots of features.
804,4,The Samsung S8 is what you expect from Samsung. The setup was easy and use is very similar to previous Samsung devices. Moving pictures and contact is a breeze with the Smart switch app. The speed and color of the screen is excellent. Maybe a little spendy without a sale. (I got mine with 20 days of Christmas door buster.) Everything has worked well on the Verizon network.
805,4,Very nice phone!!!!! Good deal!!! Would recommend...
806,5,"Haven't used it too much, just got it but I love it so far!"
807,5,"The S8 is great. Camera is fantastic, and the resources from the Samsung+ app are priceless."
808,5,"I have been using Samsung products for years, from MP3 players, tablets, and Galaxy Phones. The fit, form, and function is great. The adaptability, and user experience are also great. I despise having to use a secondary computer software to download or upload things to a phone (iTunes/Apple). Samsung makes this an easy plug and play. The camera is as good as my simple point and click digital, and way better than some others I have used. Excellent phone!!!"
809,5,Came activated and ready to use. Love Samsung and love that it is 64gb
810,5,"I love android phones and this phone is the best one. Great camera and love the screen size. S8 is a must have phone. Fast, sleek and works great."
811,5,"Overall experience was perfect! Fast, professional, courteous service. We always go with Best Buy over the Verizon store for their service!"
812,5,"I went from a Samsung Galaxy S4 to a Samsung Galaxy S8. I thought that there would be some new bells and whistles. Can I say how every wrong I was? This phone is so much better. It has a heavier feel, is so much faster, and has so much memory to do things with. The battery life lasts 3 times longer...and the phone call quality is so much better when the speaker phone is used. The camera is significantly better. Basically, Samsung has really perfected things in this model."
813,5,It lighter then other models they made and I like the camera it more clear and better and it just a great phone.
814,5,THIS IS AN AWESOME PHONE. ITS SLEEK LOOKING. BEST OF ALL ITS SUPER FAST
815,5,"Nice phone, sleek, easy to use. Intuitive. I am not fancy or techy...it works well and takes great pictures. I am happy."
816,5,Best phones I ever purchase and. The service is very reliable
817,5,I love this phone! The screen is fantastic and it is very fast.
818,4,"The phone is great, has to many apps for me. I don't know how to use all of them. The clerk was very helpful."
819,4,"I'm not sure. It is hard to get used to. I previously had a Galaxy 3 and this phone is totally different. I like some of the improvements but the galaxy 3 was so much easier to use. The message keys are too close and that makes for a lot of mistakes to be corrected. Provide better instructions with the phone to set it up. The guys at the store can do this but when you leave the store, you are on your own."
820,4,"The color of the phone I received is charcoal gray, not ""orchid"" gray like the picture. Because my previous phone was an iPhone, I am still in the process of transferring data from the old phone. I DO like the phone. The sound is amazing, the photos are really sharp! The features are easy to use."
821,5,Never had issues with Samsung phones and this one is no exception!
822,5,"Perfect for everything, there isn’t anything I would change regarding my phone."
823,5,"I have always had Samsung phone but I love this S8. I got the orchid gray, lo e the color and features. Camera is great!"
824,4,Have had it for 2 weeks now no issues. Still learning the phone.
825,4,Excellent phone great features easy to use long lasting battery.
826,2,"I have to touch thing multiple times, I still can't receive texts from iPhones, when typing the last word it type puts itself at the beginning of every sentence!"
827,5,I recently changed to this phone after all the iPhone drama and I have to say that I am happy. Good price and a fun phone.
828,3,The phone is not a cure for cancer but it's fancier than my old one.
829,1,Thin. Clumsy. Hard to guide. No notificatgion adjustment.
830,5,It's a great phone. The camera is fun. My only complaint if you want to call it that is about the reminders on my calendar but I'm sure there's a quick fix just haven't found it yet but moving the phone so far!
831,5,I bought these for my teenage kids and these were the biggest hit of the season. They love them.
832,1,I have had many samsung phones and have always loved them. This new samsung galaxy s8 is by far the worst phone I have owned since I have been born. The curved glass makes it near impossible to type with bigger fingers. Once you put on a Lifeproof case IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to type. I know samsung doesn't care about the case options but I do because I ruin phones. They counter that by offering the ACTIVE line at a larger cost but then there is no options for a case at all and I do not trust a phone without a case. The Bixby button is the most aggravating button on the phone. They should make a way to delete it from the phone completely. The bluetooth connectivity of the phone is spotty. I have nothing but issues trying to connect to my devices where my s6 had no issues at all. I regret ever purchasing this phone and I warn others to stay away if you live an active lifestyle.
833,1,Do not like edge style screen. Had I known the phone was designed this way I would have gotten anything else.
834,4,So far all good. I have had the phone for 2 weeks no issues.
835,5,I love the phone very much
836,5,"I have waited for 5 years to upgrade my S3, which still looks brand new. My son needed a new phone so we jumped on the BOGO offer. I am so impressed with all the upgrades and design of the phone. The biggest sell of an S8 to an apple is 'expandable memory' and the ease of down loading or uploading files and music. Why would you want an apple?????"
837,1,"I had the galaxy s7 edge, dropped it several times never had the screen crack, I got the s8 edge within two weeks of owning the screen shattered, and it wasn't even that bad of a hit, so I got another one which did the same thing within the first week of owning that one, I even had screen protectors and a otter box on both...Very bad phone...would not recommend to anyone."
838,2,"First phone purchased unlocked . No Visual Voicemail, returned. Second device had visual voicemail subset ROM without Voice to text transcription. Poor battery life, 3hr at most. Had missing pixels on screen. Returned and bought an iPhone 7."
839,5,This phone is more amazing than I dreamed possible.
840,5,"I have had my S8 for about 2 months now. I did some serious research before I upgraded from my S7. I always read the bad reviews first to see if there are any issues that are common within the reviews. From what I have read, most issues seem to be with the owners unfamiliarity with the operating system and certain conformity with other apps such as Android Auto and their particular vehicles idiosyncrasies. There also seem to be some Bluetooth issues that seem to be problematic within certain systems. Rather than work out the kinks, some feel that returning the phone is their best option. They may find the same issues with the phone they wind up with as well. Newer operating systems sometimes have problems with certain apps, but that does not mean that the hardware is to blame. I figured that out when Samsung pushed out nougat to the S7. I had all kinds of issues after that. My new S8 has been flawless as far as working with other apps and systems. I currently have a new Chevy and the most current Android Auto works seamlessly and connects quickly to the system. I have no issues picking up my internet from the modem and it's extenders while in my house. In my opinion, the phone is as good as the cell provider you work with. The phone structure itself is much better than my S7. The screen is awesome and responds well to my touch. I love the fact that I can add an SD card to expand the storage up to 256 GB. I store all of my photos and video on the SD card, freeing up my phone storage for more wonderful apps. I use the medium power setting and the battery lasts all day but needs to charge at night (quick charge takes about an hour to fully charge the phone). I have never owned a smart phone that has lasted more than a day, no matter what the manufacturer claimed and I have owned HTC, Blackberry,Motorola and Samsung. They all last a day under normal my use. I keep a external storage battery on hand if I go to an amusement park or some other events. I have read about some issues that have manifested themselves after several months of use. I cannot comment on these because I have not owned my current phone that long. As with all phones, the glass screen is breakable if dropped the wrong way. I owned my S7 for about 2 years and after repeated drops finally managed to cause a separation between the glass and some backing, hence my upgrade. I insure my phones as everyone should consider doing who spend upwards of 1K for their pocket computer. As for me, I perfectly satisfied with my S8. The face recognition works decently and the fact that the finger print pad is on the back of the phone, I have not found this to be an issue as some others have.If anything changes in my satisfaction, I will amend this comment, but until that time, this is a great smart phone."
841,3,I loved my 5S. However I really needed to upgrade so I chose the S8. Haven't read the book yet and I am finding it hard to do the things I so easily did before. And I am being driven crazy by all the ADS that appear.
842,5,I’m really impressed by how quick this phone is. The pictures come out so clear. It’s really easy to back n forth quickly from one app to another. I definitely will put my stamp of approval on this product.
843,5,"Excellent device, met all my expectations and is very useful."
844,4,I love my new S8. One thing I do not like is the sencitivity on the keyboard. I have to hit my letters harder and really watch the auto spell check. Getting used to the edge and still out on if I really like it better than the regular screen. Still a really nice phone.
845,5,Best resolution and camera ever!!!! Perfect screen size!!
846,5,This phone rocks and o used to have a phone Apple will never be king in the cell phone market
847,1,"I've had this phone for a total of 7 days now and I can say the infinity screen is terrible. If I hold the phone wrong it taps things, or clicks out of apps. Also ordered a case online and thus have had to be very careful with it, but unfortunately it fell out of my pocket from a total of 3 feet off the ground and the entire screen cracked thanks to the screen being around the edge of the phone. If you want a durable phone, do not get this one. Don't waste the $ and don't fall into the insurance that makes you pay for repairs. I'm basically stuck with a broken phone now after just a week of having it, after 1 minor accident."
848,5,This phone does not dissapoint. The battery life is excellent.. The display is amazing.. And I love how customizable it is... In a matter of mins had this phone exactly how I wanted it!
849,4,"Difficult to turn on and off with case placed on phone. Sometimes difficult to activate icons, you must be exactly on one and have to press hard at times. My Galaxy7 was easier to operate. It's just going to take getting use too."
850,5,"The new Samsung Galaxy S8 is amazing. It has so many neat features and functions that I'm still working through them all. As a loyal android user, I'm loving this phone."
851,3,Have owned several generations of Galaxys but hate the round edge
852,5,samsung really went all out with this phone and to me it worth the price there a lot of really cool features.
853,5,"Left Samsung when I begrudgingly upgraded from a Note 4 to another company's phablet when the Note 7 had it's issues. Now I am thankfully back! Couldn't be happier. Great battery life. Beautiful display. Great new S Pen features. Short of a removable battery, I couldn't ask for more."
854,5,Samsung is best company in the world
855,5,Best phone we've ever had!!!
856,5,I had the s7 Edge and this is so much better. I only dropped 1 time which was the only fall it took to break. This s8 fits much better in a case than the edge did.
857,5,Love it. Great performance. Amazing battery. Video and camera extraordinary.
858,1,I despise the file management logic. Aweful
859,5,"I bought my at an ATT store, and instantly I was in love with my new phone. Almost everything can be personalized except for one really annoying little button called Bixby, which has no apps that work with it that I want to use. My solution was to mute Bixby, but wish I could have that button work the app of my choice. Probably would just disable it though. The next huge issue that I have is the flat fingerprint scanner. On my old Nexus phone it had a concave finger print scanner on the back that could read your finger print in any direction, but on the Samsung phone you have to have you finger perfectly aligned or it wont be able to read your finger, and its sucks because as my beautiful nails grow, I can no longer use the finger print scanner. My last issue is the keyboard. The Samsung keyboard really sucks bad. I should have replaced it with another on the first day, but I didn't. Now that I have, the thing is amazing. The camera on this phone is better than that on my Lecia digital camera, or should I say a lot easier to use, the Lecia has too many technical options for me. But I can take better product shots with my phone than the Lecia. My last phone only came with a little bit of internal storage, so of course I love the ample storage on the S8. The sound volume & quality is also super amaizing."
860,3,Samsung s8 eight is a very good but bixby doesn’t work like I thought it would and it does not have a fast internet or lock screen why does it only work for it when ever it restarts
861,5,"This phone is tops, the battery lasts, they have a 4 amp charger and does more than I can believe. I recommend it emphatically."
862,4,It gets me to where I want to go faster.
863,5,"My wife and I love our new S8 , the size and the look of the phone and everything about it. You would have to go a long ways to bet this one."
864,5,Everyday I use the S8 there’s something new I learn about it. There are features on it that I didn’t even demand or know about that let’s you adjust it in a way that will form your perfect cellular device. It’s not as restrictive as other phones like the IPhone. You can do so much with it. I hate myself for not learning more about the Galaxy phones earlier in my life. I remember the times I had with the IPhone 5 and it really seems like a misery.
865,2,I was happy to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy S8. Then I found out I have no bluetooth. Who would roll out/sell a device in 2017 that is not compatible with my auto bluetooth? Or any bluetooth? I doubt I'll keep it
866,4,Absolutely hate that Bixby assistant built in the phone! She's horrible when you try to speak for messaging and she spells everything wrong. I Googled a way to turn her off and and install Google assistant again. Now I'm happy. Only four stars because I wish the screen was a little wider it's smaller than the S7
867,2,I had no choice but to receive the S8. I don't like it always had the Note. This phone is so sensitive. I've made more mistakes typing than I have ever done with any phone.
868,4,Only issue I have had is not being able to send/receive text messages intermittently. It seems the only way to fix it is to turn off advanced messaging and at times I need to turn of the WIFI to get it to work.
869,5,The s8 is everything it was advertised to be. I switched from iOS after they issued two updates to correct issues with ios11. I'm glad I did. Forgot how much fun android can be
870,5,"What an incredible phone. Very fast, beautiful display and great connectivity. Works great with my Gear S3. This is the best phone I've ever owned. Would higjly reccomend this to anyone."
871,5,"Granted I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 so I was way behind on tech. I love the facial, fingerprint & PIN security features. It is faster and I love the full screen view. I;m sure there are many other things that I haven't found yet."
872,4,"It was not as shiny as it was described. There wasn't a lot of bloatware, which I appreciate. Bixby is not as easy to use as it pretends to be. I would like the contact photos to fill at least half the screen when on the phone instead of the size of a nickel. I haven't found a huge use for the side panels yet. I'm thinking that it's not bad....just not great."
873,4,"Nice phone , great features, have to get use to no buttons and fingerprint sensor on back"
874,5,Love it. Would definitely recommend this to friends.
875,5,"I don't run out to buy every new phone out there. I have had my Samsung 5 for several years now. It was time to retire my old phone, and was really dreading the whole process of buying and setting up a new phone. My apprehension was totally unfounded... This phone is simple to set up, and simple to use. I love the camera, I was able to take some really great shots at grand daughter's softball game!"
876,5,My son loved it he had it figured out in 5 minutes .we plan on getting the vr2017 with it soon.
877,3,I was torn between going to a newer iPhone or moving to the Galexy S8. I'm a basic user but i love photography. My husband suggested I go to this better phone system. It turns out it's too different and I wish I'd stayed with the IPhone's.
878,3,This is the first Galaxy I have used after 10 years of iPhone. Takes time to adjust to the controls. The one thing that is unforgivable is that you have to always check your voicemails. Missed calls are recorded on the phone icon with the typical red alert but voicemails are hidden away in the phone icon.
879,1,Just purchased 2 phones to replace my Galaxy s5. Feel like I have gone back in time. The phone is bland and the touch sensitivity is very stiff. The apps and the text messaging is very archaic. I may be taking them back to the store tomorrow.
880,5,"the phone is great. it is different than our last phone, so there is some getting use to. the phone is very fast and has some great uses."
881,5,I liked it very much. Look and feel awesome. Especially camera superb my kids want to take picture using s8. Sharp pictures.
882,1,Phone would not update had to do so manually with a computer. Not durable fully glass better buy a case when you get the phone. Water proof but not durable.
883,1,"It appears Samsung rushed the Galaxy S8 to the market without fixing camera glitches, i.e., camera failure."
884,1,"Sooo, I was absolutely in love with my Samsung 7, and after having the S8 for about 4 months, I already want to go back to my old phone. Within the 1st 2 weeks, my advanced messaging stopped working which wouldn't allow me to send or receive messages. Then my phone stopped vibrating or ringing when I received notifications, so I constantly have to check my phone to see what I've missed. And now my volume button doesn't work. I hate this phone."
885,5,Loving my new phone and smart watch.
886,3,"I have been an avid Samsung user; however, I am disappointed in the S8. I have had the phone less than 2 months and the signs of wear are unbelievable. I am not rough on my phones. In fact...I have never had a case on one and never have had any issues. The phone is scratched like I slide it across the table...let it ride in cup holders...etc. Very disappointing Samsung! If people are going to pay this much money...it should be able to withstand everyday use without looking like it has gone through a natural disaster."
887,3,"Already having problems, and only been a few months. When calling someone, they can hear me but I can't hear them. Very broken up reception. Also, delay in sending text messages. Not impressed."
888,3,The are no different between 6 or 8
889,3,"It's a great phone with a military quality body, but there is people that have spoke about the screen being soft and I would have to agree my boyfriend had the phone for three days pulled it out of his pocket and half the screen has scratches on it.. I'm extremely mad!!! They should of built the screen better..."
890,4,It reacts slow to get the opening page. It has taken some time to get used to the different features which by the way I like.
891,5,"How manageable is your videos , photos"
892,4,Excellent sound and reception. Best hot spot connection I have ever had! Speaker is great. Pictures are great. Lots of little nice features I am still learning about
893,2,"Phone was great when I first got it. 3 weeks in and constant reboots 10-15 times per day. Booted into safe mode to make sure it wasn't a 3rd party app. Cleared cache, even did factory reset. Still have the same issue. Right before it reboots, random apps like Google play, Samsung touch wiz, etc... crash, phone freezes then reboots. Happens overnight while charging, even while sitting on my desk when not in use. Searched around and this is a common issue. Too bad because I really like the phone otherwise."
894,5,"Very good experience, nothing to complaint about."
895,5,I have always been a Samsung fan since the S1.
896,5,I had a Nokia Lumia that quit after about 5 years. It was a great phone and very easy to use. I was sold an Apple phone that was impossible to navigate. I returned it and got the galaxy S8 and find it a pleasure to use. It functions very close to the Nokia so was very easy to set up.
897,5,"It is what you would want in a SMART phone,easy to use and function"
898,5,Great phone. Works great easy to use. Amazing phone.
899,5,"Perfect step-up from my old phone, very easy to use."
900,1,"Before you buy, search yourself on how bad the bluetooth is. There is a 64 page thread on Samsung forums of people complaining that they cant stream music in their cars, cant connect their headphones etc etc. The bluetooth range and connectivity is horrendous and has been since the phone came out. None of the updates have addressed this issue. If I could I would return this phone in a heartbeat and get back my S6 or even worse get an Apple....."
901,5,This phone is amazing. More user friendly. I like it verte much.
902,2,"Great camera, lots of functions easy to use UNTIL you put a screen protector on. Then it's difficult and a time soaker to get the touch screen to respond to every touch. Do yourself a favor and get a flat screen phone if you're like me and protect the screen."
903,5,"not complain for this phone, i like everything, battery its great to.."
904,4,The phone is as I expected-better than the S6 I previously owned!
905,5,"I've had my S8 for a few weeks now and I love it. I've been an android user for years and I knew when deciding in getting a new phone that wasn't going to change. The s8 is very intuitive. There are many aspects of it that make day to day things just much easier. If you're looking for an ABOVE average phone highly recommend. I personally enjoy using Bixby, the personal assistant (much like siri). The Bixby breifing is nice to wake up to in the morning. Tells you what time it is and the weather."
906,5,"Easy to use, takes great pictures, love it"
907,5,Love this phone. Great pictures. Easy to use.
908,5,"This phone is good looking, takes great pictures and it is easy to learn how to use all it's features. I'd recommend it highly."
909,5,Really like the look and perforfance
910,5,This phone is amazing. Super easy to set up and the battery life is phenomenal. It's the best! Samsung has done it right again.
911,5,"Had an iPhone 5 and then a 6. Both sucked at running business apps (SalesForce1). Struggled with the iPhone 6 for 2 years. The day my contract with ATT was up and the phone paid for, I went to Sam's and bought the Galaxy S8+. I thought I would hate it for the first couple of weeks until I got back up to speed on an Android device. Not so. The Smart Transfer software in the S8 pulled all data, apps and email settings off the iphone in minutes. This phone is LIGHT YEARS ahead of Apple and it runs my business apps with lightning speed and reliability. My wife has an iPhone 7 and thinks it is OK but when I show her features on my S8, she just shakes her head. I can see the envy... Our #2 son was visiting last weekend. I showed him my S8. He played with it for about 30 minutes and afterward said, ""I like this phone!. I am going to get one of these. It is so smooth and responsive compared to my iPhone 7."" And there you have it folks, another convert and all he did was touch it."
912,4,"Would be a 5 star 10/10 phone for sure if the screen was more durable. Slid out of my pocket 5 days after having it from about 3 feet above the ground, first time being dropped and the screen cracked instantly. No way this phone has guerilla glass. Other than that it is the best phone on the market. 3 months after getting it and I am still finding new features every day. Might be cracked but it is solid ✊"
913,5,"I got the Galaxy s8 to replace my 3 year old note 4. It had quit charging. Wasn't sure I would like a smaller phone, but it's not too much smaller. Very fast internet. LOVE the camera. Better than my note. Battery life is pretty good. Always charged my note multiple times a day. This one gets charged 2x and I'm a heavy phone user. Very happy with my new phone. I plan on having this for several years. And ots a beautiful phone. Very sleek and smooth."
914,3,Phone dead about 2 hours of heavy use but charges quick
915,5,phone takes excellent pictures & videos calls are crisp & not fuzzy
916,1,"Drop it once! Great phone... Unless you drop it just once. There are no case covers to protect the Samsung galaxy s8 from drops on the side edges of the screen, not even Otter box. Everyone drops their phone at one time or another... And on a flat surface you would expect your phone to be protected with a reputable case... But no, not with the Samsung Galaxy S8... There is no case designed to protect the side edges of the screen, even with a flat surface drop. My advice is to save your Money and buy a product better thought through, and through a manufacturer who has case covers suited to protect it's product... Samsung galaxy s8 is not such a product!"
917,3,"I don't necessarily care for bixby and am slightly bothered by the side button that's easy to accidentally press. I do enjoy the screen size and the waterproof aspect, but I've ran into some troubles where the phone would freeze for 2 minutes at a time. One day the screen stayed black for over 10 min. Determined to not give up on this 1 month old phone, I did a hard reboot with success on the second try. I've been frustrated, because I usually stick to the cheaper smartphones which have had less problems in the first year of use."
918,3,"This new phone is feature rich. The recent update to Bixby makes it usable. The bigger issue is they claim the screen is almost indestructible, it slid off the coffee table and hit the floor cracking the screen. I only had the phone for less than 2 months when this happened. I previously had a Moto X that was virtually impossible to damage"
919,1,I wanted a phone with a larger capacity memory and now im stuck
920,2,After having the phone for only a week I've noticed scratches on the screen and the back of the phone. I am using the phone exactly as I've had all of my previous phones which did not have scratches after a year+ of use.
921,4,"I enjoy the camera, and the featrues associated with this upgrade. However, sometimes I am unable to view Instagram videos."
922,5,I love the new Galaxy S8. Best phone I have ever had. Easy to use.
923,5,I love everything about this phone.
924,5,A great phone easy to use
925,4,love the new phone. New platform is very nice and user friendly.
926,3,"Got this phone for my husband, upgrading from an s5 active. This phone is much slimmer and sleeker than the s5 active. It looks and works great, but he has a hard time holding on to it with his mechanics hands. Going to have to get a case for it and see if that helps."
927,5,"So far love the phone, Works great no issue's and the camera is awesome!!"
928,5,Still getting used to the new apps. Having trouble downloading ringtones other than the Samsung ringtones. Wish there was a way to lower volume from screen. Otherwise I like it.
929,5,I like most of the features. Still having problems learning some of the apps. Having difficulty trying to learn how to back up my documents. I have tried to change my ring tone to a personalized one and I am unable to complete it. I have it downloaded on my phone but unlike my LG phone I cannot figure out how to make it ring that tone.
930,4,"I love this phone. It's super fast, sleek, intuitive, and has a huge screen. It's got the external memory option, which is awesome. Also, I really like that it's water and dust resistant (I'm clumsy). It fits in the hand well, too. In the down side, it's so sleek it seems hard to hold on to (My wife dropped hers twice so far). Relatedly, the curved screen (which I definitely like) makes it mostly glass and, thus, kinda fragile. I hate to make it bulky abd cover it with a case, but it seems necessary. All in all, I highly recommend it!"
931,1,"I upgraded from the Samsung 5 and was very disappointed. The new phone is very difficult to operate. Every feature has been changed, but only for change sake. Icons are miniscule in size and every action is punctuated with a sales pitch from someone- even auditory ads that suddenly occur."
932,5,"Greatest phone I have ever used does more than I even know yet finding new things every day or seems like it, love it"
933,5,Wonderful product. I enjoy it!
934,5,"I have been seeing the TV ads and commercials about the ph. ""Oh i love it, its the best"", ""feels great""...I thought bla, bla...I LOVE this phone. Feels great in my hands, smooth, easy to use and Bixby, LOVE her..."
935,5,Love my new phone. Samsung girl for sure.
936,4,"It's a pretty nice phone, the only thing I dislike is the rolled edges make typing more difficult because it seems the screen sensitivity isn't as much as on the flat surface. So words get misspelled frequently"
937,5,"best one yet, I have had alot of phnes but this is the best."
938,4,"Nice product, but i wanted some better"
939,5,I enjoy the s8 easy to navigate apps. Screen is easy to scratch
940,1,"This phone is supposed to have ""gorilla glass"". I dropped my phone from my lap onto laminate flooring after getting up from my sofa. It fell face first and when I picked it up the entire face of the phone was destroyed beyond repair! Deeply disappointed. I purchased this phone because of its ""shatter proof"" feature."
941,4,"I wish I had purchased a screen protector when I got the phone. The very next day I had a small scratch on the screen. Of course now I'm just going to have to have a very expensive scratched new phone. The sales girl asked me if I wanted one, but did not truly impress upon me the importance of a screen protector with the way this device is designed. I mean come on, a phone like this and the glass should be strong enough to hold up at least the first few days without incident. Should have done more research before purchasing. I went in the next day on got a $40.00 screen protector, the next week my phone fell and it popped right off. They need to make a better designed screen protector. Should have paid for the lifeproof. Make sure you get a screen protector for this phone!"
942,4,Quite a change from my SIII. It seems a little harder to the touch on the screen. It could be because I got a glass cover. Also I bought the billfold case. When I take it out of the case the touch screen works much easier.
943,5,"Phone is lightweight in carrying or holding which enables its durability. The screen and large and bright, providing excellent backgrounds and pictures. The camera has many options in changing views, pixels, and other photo mechanisms that will create that perfect moment. Bixby is very helpful once you set it up to your preferences and likeness."
944,5,Love this phone! Just hope it's durable.
945,5,"The S8 is the quickest moving phone I've ever owned. By that I mean it is fast....between applications and even in routine use. I'm assuming it has a superior operating system. I still have a lot to learn about the phone, but I couldn't be happier with the purchase."
946,5,"I love this celular. Fast, beautiful and economic."
947,5,"This has got to be my favorite phone I've ever had! Not only is it nice and sleek, there are so many things you can do and Samsung has thought if everything with this phone!"
948,5,"I really liked the phone, now that Bixby voice has been fixed it is even better. Both front and rear cameras take great pictures, I don't need to use my point and shoot at all. Bixby is a really great addition. The 64GB is not shabby."
949,5,Absolutely love this phone!
950,5,"Nice upgrade, does everything I need and more. Impressive photo quality too."
951,1,Does a lot of things you probably don't want and make it difficult to do what you want. Plan on googling and research for most every change. Then an update and it is rearranged for you. Process starts over again.
952,5,Battery life and phone features are outstanding.
953,5,"Love my phone. Slim, easy to hold, use, my daughters are envious. I don't think I will be changing soon."
954,5,My daughter enjoys her new phone
955,1,"I've been a loyal Samsung Galaxy fan for years. I recently purchased the new S8 and to say I am highly disappointed would be an understatement. The screens (front and back) are way too fragile for smart phone use. Both of my screens cracked in the first few days from simple (dare I say normal) accidents. The front screen cracked when I dropped the phone on my carpeted office floor from my desk - approximately 27.5"". The rear screen cracked when it literally hit the side of my bed as I knocked it off the nightstand while silencing a 0500 alarm...then fell to our Berber carpeted floor. I paid a hefty penny for a phone that is entirely too fragile and is no longer weather resistant...thanks to the cracked glass. I was quoted a ridiculous sum from a local repair shop to fix both sets of glass. I've decided to hold onto my cracked phone until the S9 comes out and hopefully is equipped with more resilient glass. Oh did I mention I had a Zagg cover on the front glass? Save your cash...keep your S7 and avoid this phone as if it had the plague."
956,1,I did not like this phone. I returned this phone within 14 days. I was charged a restocking fee
957,4,Don't like the headphone jack at the bottom of the phone. The crop feature in the photo gallery is AWFUL and difficult to use.
958,1,Bad experience from time I purchased the Galaxy8 until I returned it 1 day after receiving it. Majority of problems created by bad info from AT&T customer service representatives. Change From IPhone to Android info given to me was different from rep to rep. I will not continue my mobile service with AT&T once my contract is fulfilled.
959,5,My husband loves it. Easy to set up and easy to find things
960,1,"I bought this phone in a corporate store yesterday. As soon as I got in the car and tried to turn on Google Apps it froze and shut down/crashed 3 times. I went back in and showed the manager what was happening, and it stopped for a while and he told me to take it home and use it for a few days and bring it back. It was basically unusable, any time I tried to do anything, load an app, change settings etc., it would just freeze and crash. I had to pay to get a different phone but at least I'm not dealing with terrible Samsung phones anymore!"
961,3,Phone is great size is perfect software is super fast but phone is very fragile... breaks with anytjimng and it's slippery so get a case for it asap!
962,5,Great phone... And the battery holds longer. Nice size..
963,4,"Great phone, lots of cool things to learn to use. Hard to type/text on, and very sensitive well except for taking a screenshot. I was a long time apple product person but so glad i took the leap to samsung."
964,5,"Absolutely LOVE my new phone. I can not say enough about it. Camera is perfection, download speed is out of this world, fast, fast,charging time."
965,5,"The camera is awesome, display is great! The battery could be better, but overall it's an awesome phone. I love Samsung!"
966,4,When the young man transferred all my information from my old phone to my new one. My contact info was nothing but a bunch of random numbers. I lost a few of my older photos. Otherwise the phone is great.
967,4,"The galaxy s8 is super similar to the older galaxies. I love all the features and have always been happy with these phones. Video playback, sound quality and camera are all great. I sbsolutely hate the curved screen on this phone however. There was no other option, as the s8 plus also comes with a curved screen. I do not see the point of it and the fit of the screen protector is terrible. It is difficult to apply enough pressure to the touch screen with the protector on, however, I will not use this phone without one. The screen protector is already cracked on my phone after two weeks of normal use. Haven't dropped it at all, just broke it my pocket. Theres nothing wrong with the quality of the screen protector, it is the curved design of the phone and also the protector that makes it break that easily. Very frustrating."
968,3,"Pros: Battery , camera pics Cons: taking screen shots harder, change in power plug , power plug doesn't like other cords to be used other than Samsung, adapters are really small and easy to miss place"
969,2,"I had a iPhone for years wish I never switched. Android system hard to operate. Got new Samsung 8, won't keep WiFi on. Some apps disappear. Very disappointed!"
970,5,I think it's a great product easy to use and conveniently fits in your pocket.
971,5,"I got the orchid gray, which I did not think that I would. The picture does not look anything like what the color really looks like. It is a lovely color. The phone itself is stunning. The quality of the screen is beyond what I thought was possible. I am not a super techy person but I can tell you that the phone is super fast. Issues I read about like the finger print scanner being difficult to use are a non issue as far as I am concerned. It is easy to access and is easy to use.I love that the phone is a little more narrow than the s7 because getting my hand around it is much easier, so one handed use is no longer frustrating. I also think the non physical home buttons aren't a problem either. I thought maybe I would have a problem with that but I didn't at all. Overall a great phone (so far). I would highly recommend it, especially while att has the trade in for 200.00. Made the phone way less expensive."
972,5,I am enjoying my new Samsung 8 phone. It has a phenomenal camera and I have gotten many compliments on the quality of my photos. I would recommend this phone. It has some great features as well.
973,5,"this is the ideal phone, fast, handsome, water proof, dust proof everyting we have been waiting for in a phone."
974,5,Got it for the wife. She loves it. Takes way better pics than my iPhone 6. I think I'm gonna finally have to cross over to the dark side of android. Great looking phone. The 3D photo thing is awesome.
975,2,"There isn't any product out there that will adequately protect the screen. The extra stuff that curved screen does, not needed, waste of time! Less is more."
976,5,Love the screen! It's so easy to use.
977,5,"I had my reserves on switching, from always an iphone person to galaxy. I was offered this deal from work for the new galaxy s8 no employee of att should've passed... and I said to my self, lets give it a try. What the worst that could happend, if i hated it, I just resume using my iphone 6 and wait for the new iphone X coming in fall. The best thing about iphone is that apple understands its consumer and offers what they want and needs, simplicity without the unnecessary steps that us iphone users are not used to. At 1st, I hated dealing with open market and having to consent, affirm and comply to everything, as well as the security allow for everything and re-directs to be able to acomplish things. So, how did I manage and learned in 1 month how to overcome all my android open market fears and simplify my galaxy life...???. I turned it into an iphone ..!!! Easy-peasy....; Just downloaded a security app for monitoring health of my device and shut down all automatics, only allowing those that i trust. The Galaxy s8 also comes with customizable icon view option to make it look and feel like an ipnone, ain't that something. And best, but not the least, shut off Annoying BIXBY..!!!. Now my phone is my tool, and not the other way around. Now I can say the phone is great with superb features. Pictures are the best and its resolution is just sick awsome. It is a great buy once you figure it out. I love my new Samsung iPhone S8, or is it my Apple Galaxy S8, which ever sounds about right... ;-)"
978,5,"Works fine, good size, like it better than the Note 4 I had before."
979,5,I love it. Much better than my S6. Battery lasts all day and always works unlike my last phone and carrier. Would like a dedicated voicemail icon and voicemail to text function
980,5,"The features and performance of this phone are incredible! Face recognition, thumb print, wireless charging, infinite screen, water proof. Too many to list. I've owned every major manufacturer's cell phone since they were invented and this beats them all!"
981,4,"I love everything about this phone , except the screen protectors and glass cover for it don't stay on it ."
982,5,"The cámara is So amazing the battery last the hole day it, the battery doesn't drain it."
983,5,"We took the deal on the S8, two for one package and are very happy with the new phones. These are replacements for two HTC One's M8 & M9. The transition was pretty seamless. The S8's are easy to use and offer several advantages in the quality of sound and camera."
984,4,Love photos are great easy to use LOVE the edge
985,5,Great phone. Like the new features
986,5,He loves it. Camera is fantastic!
987,1,Keyboard is crazy to work. Skips letters. Constant misspellings. Hate the calendar. Apps not very good. I always have had Samsung and really disappointed in the 8. Honestly the s5 a d the mega was better.
988,1,"I've been a Samsung supporter dating back to the Galaxy Note 2. In fact I still use this device around the house, connected to wifi, and have never had any issues with it. My most recent device has been a Note 4. This device was also wonderful. Yesterday I upgraded to the Galaxy S8. Even though the Samsung brand has taken a hit with the Note 7, I still believed that the Galaxy products were of high quality, I decided to remain loyal and continue with another Galaxy phone. That opinion has now changed. My 26 hour experience with the S8 is leading me to rethink my opinion of all Samsung devices. While driving home from dinner, my device slipped out of my pocket and wedged itself between the seat and plastic console. A drop of less than 6 inches caused a spiderweb crack that has reached all 4 sides of the device. It's unacceptable to me for a device to crack under such conditions. I've known Galaxy phones to be sturdy, high quality phones; and somehow the S8 does not meet the same standards previous Galaxy phones have. My first instinct is that I must have received a defective device, as all my previous experiences with Galaxy devices have been positive. Returning from dinner though, I looked into reviews of this device, and durability has been called do into question. I would hate to see that this is how the brand has changed. I'm not sure I can remain a Samsung user under these circumstances. I've resisted switching over to Apple devices for years, but given these circumstances, it may be time to switch."
989,5,"It's not a huge difference from the S7, but the screen to body ratio is great. A few changes in the software is nice, and easy to use."
990,5,I am loving my new S8! I'm still learning the new features but so far I am very pleasantly surprised!
991,5,Bought the phone for my daughter. she thought couldn't do without her iPhone. But within 2 days she wouldn't trade for the world she loves her new samsung
992,5,"So far it's living up to its name. A few things are different in an annoying way, but only because it different. Great new features."
993,2,"not very efficient phone for few reasons and here I'm comparing with S5 that I have 1. text message: a text comes in while you're on the phone, the text doesn't show message body that you can read while in the phone. S5 does. 2. Call logs: there is no call log feature for you to sort dial, missed, received, rejected calls. S5 does. 3. Samsung key: doesn't automatically pop up spelling between languages. I used 4 languages interchangeably when I text or email. S5 understands the language I'm using and pop up correct spelling. With S8, I have to move the space bar to pick the language if I want to type a word in that particular language. it takes longer for my text nowaday. Not fun. Very inconvenient and time consuming. 5. Calculator: too many keys and features that make the keys too busy. 6. Battery: short life. 5 hrs for constant talk and web surf. 7 hrs for doing nothing. I'm in finance, I used the phone dial logs, text and calculator a lot and I got frustrated. I remove the Sim card and put it back to my S5 :-)"
994,1,"I don't like it. I was told that I could transfer every thing from my iPhone, I can't. I am having difficulties syncing it to the Samsung pad. It's missing so many features that the iPhone has."
995,2,"AVOID THIS PHONE AT ALL COST! I got it recently and for the first week or so i loved it, there was nothing wrong with it until my screen protector broke then within a day I had 5 scratches. So, do not get it if scratches and cracks annoy you."
996,5,Awesome experience-highly recommended!!!
997,5,I absolutely love this phone. Previous phone was a Samsung Mega 6.3 so this was a bit narrower but handling it ok. Of course battery life could be better but then again we can't have everything
998,4,Love the phone but the protective cover sucks it cracked the 2nd day I had my phone )
999,5,Phone has a clear glass screen. Love it.
1000,1,The phone sometime not revive phone call
1001,5,My wife had a Samsung Galaxy S5 and decided it was time to update/upgrade. She couldn't be happier she chose the S8. Everything was moved from the old phone to the new phone and she was off and running.
1002,5,"My Samsung S8 is a wonderful, phone I enjoy the internect."
1003,5,"Love,Love, Love! Still finding great features everyday! But am totally bummed out about not having the 10 second message delay!!! Why,why, why would you take that AWAY???"
1004,5,"I've had the Note 2 & 3 plus the S7 edge. I really like this phone. The battery life is great & it's easy to use. I still have no use for the edge screen & Bixby gets on my nerves but other than that, I'm happy with the S8."
1005,5,"Samsung did not disappoint with this phone. Everything is better - pictures, screen quality, ease of use, tools, and Bixby!"
1006,5,"I've been putting off upgrading from my current samsaung, but now I look at it and play around with all the time wondering why did u wait!"
1007,4,The phone works fine. The delete icon needs to be moved.
1008,2,"The primary reason I purchased this phone over the iPhone was the ability to add memory. My S8 appears to disconnect with sd card many times a day. The apps I have transferred to the card become unavailable at least 4 or 5 times per hour. Restarting the phone does temporarily resolve the issue, however I feel it's an unacceptable glitch and for all of the good features this phone this one problem destroys the experience of this phone for me."
1009,5,I must say this is a great updgrade from my s4 which has stood by me since with AT&T.
1010,5,This is my 3 Galaxy phone and by far the best at doing all the little things that make a phone an asset. From quick access to my favorite apps to being fast at laoding and running them. Great Phone!
1011,5,"Went from a S4 to a S8 and the world of difference is astounding. For those of you who don't make such a leap it most likely doesn't seem so. Even new my S4 didn't have the color and overall graphics the S8 does. I'm playing games on my phone, something I never did with the S4, always locking up. This size is great. Big enough to see yet not as overly large as the iphone/tablet they produced. Absolutely love the wrapped screen!!!"
1012,4,So far it works great. Well pleased with it.
1013,4,The 8 is better than the S5 and maybe the S6 without the battery problem of 7. Adding the app Bixby is irritating to try to turn off. It is not really user friendly. The screen still gets hot at times and it will freeze some when too many apps try to work
1014,5,Great phone little pricey but great phone
1015,5,Better then iphone 7 !! Recommend to all !!
1016,5,"Love it, love it Love it !!!!"
1017,5,"Excellent quality pictures especially low light visibility. Sleek looking and easy to use. Long battery life, whether with talk time and in stand by"
1018,5,GREAT EASY TO USE. GOOD SCREEN SIZE
1019,4,"The screen protector makes the most basic tasks difficult. Other than that works very well, good battery and fast."
1020,5,"Samsung has outdone themselves this time. First of all, thanks for bringing back ability to input outside storage. Next, the camera!!! OMG! I absolutely love it. The Snapchat choices are too cute. The battery life is super. And I just love it."
1021,5,Excellent product thus far...
1022,3,"this phone is a typical bad samsung phone, will not hold a charge, and randomly shuts off."
1023,2,The screen will break from like 1.5 feet even if dropped perfectly fine I like the phone but screen is terrible there is no way it is Gorilla glass 5.
1024,5,"Just upgraded from a S6 to the S8 and I'm very glad I did. The battery charges way faster and lasts much longer that the S6. The display is sharper, and it runs faster. I'm not a gamer, don't use it to watch videos or TV, but I do use my phone to take pictures while travelling. That is the real reason for my decision to upgrade to the S8 and I'm very pleased with better quality of the camera on the S8. All-in-all, I'm happy with my decision to move to the S8."
1025,1,"If Samsung were trying to make a phone that would ultimately make me want to switch to an IPhone, this is the one! Bluetooth works sometimes, sometimes it does not. Camera is nowhere near as good as advertised, don't like the curved screen, loaded with useless apps that you can't uninstall, etc. I could keep on going but I would highly recommend NOT buying this phone."
1026,4,"Phone is ok, cannot see why it cost so much!"
1027,1,"I bought this phone for my Mom about 10 days ago. Not only did it constantly freeze on her, but she was holding it in her hand by her side and the screen cracked for no reason. Just shattered right where the front facing camera is and spread throughout the rest of the phone. Something this expensive shouldn't break just by holding it. Of course, warranty doesn't cover physical damage of the phone and insurance makes you pay for it even if it's a manufacturing issue. Definitely don't recommend buying this phone."
1028,1,"I had my phone IN A CASE and it fell 6 inches, and shattered. Ridiculous. They need to recall these as being defective."
1029,5,"Did quite a bit of research on the net and youTube before settling on it, bought it, spent 20+ hours setting it up, and, realized that if you take time to know it, it's simply awesome. The display is terrific, even covered with a good screen protector (I use Illumi Aquashield), I set a picture of my kids as wallpaper and it seems like it's etched on ceramic, the curved screen makes the picture a piece of art. Apps load instantly, and the SD cart allowed me to add 128GB to the standard 64GB for cheap. Some reviewers don't like the fingerprint on the rear, but a secret: with a good case like a Spigen, it is so easy to feel the opening for the lens, you just put your finger to one side of the opening and unlock your phone instantly - no risk of smudging the camera lens. I agree that without a case, it was much harder, but I would never use such an expensive phone without a case - would you? The Spigen herringbone looks great, feels great. Customizing the theme, the wallpaper, the lock screen, the ""always on"" screen are all very easy, and organizing app icons is a charm. Just longpress and either pick from the context menu or drag where you want it; dragging an icon on top of another one automatically creates a group you can name. So I now have ONE app screen with a group for each thing, e.g Communications, Office, Finance, Shopping, Travel etc... And it charges so fast with a fast charge wireless charger, and the battery lasts plenty for a full day of work (I do 5:00AM to 6:00PM) and an evening of playing with it. I'm still in love after 1.5 week of ownership."
1030,3,Disappointed there isn't a phone case that protects the screen. The glass screen covers available keeps popping off. its very easy to damage the screen without a protective cover or one that keeps coming off. I have replaced to glass screen protector 2x the first week I've Owens this phone
1031,5,Love the design and the feel.
1032,1,I think for such a high price it does not hold up to normal use. I consider normal use minor drops. I have been very disappointed with it so far. And the assistance or lack of from the AT&T store.
1033,4,It's great I love the camera!
1034,4,The phone is ok. Camera takes great pictures. Volume is better than other phones. Hate bixby!!! Don't want it on my phone. Told it would cancel out my warranty if I had it removed. Don't like where the bixby function is located.
1035,3,This phone has a lot of great features but it is difficult to text
1036,5,pictures are clear and perfect front and back owesome
1037,5,Great step forward for the Samsung Galaxy 8!! VERY HAPPY!!
1038,4,very good phone highly recommend if willing to pay the price
1039,5,Loe the size of the screen and it wasn't wider. Fits nicely in my palm.
1040,5,"Over all, top of the line phone. I love it!"
1041,5,large screen and really fast
1042,5,"I upgraded from a Galaxy Note II to the S8 so as you can imagine, the S8 has quite a few options that I didn't have with my previous phone. The customizations you can make on this phone is neverending. The camera is amazing which is one of the main reasons for buying it. It also has many different security settings. I haven't used Bixby yet, but I have read that more features will be coming in the next several months. The only thing I REALLY MISS from the Note series is the built-in stylus."
1043,2,After a trrifying experience with AT&T customer service to upgrade my line with the S8 I have realized that I should not have gone with the recommendation I was given. It is very heavy and somewhat awkwardly shaped so drops very easily. It is heavy so it lands hard and broke in less than a week. I am not happy with it at all but due to it's awkwardness I can't exchange it.
1044,1,Ordered the phone and very disappointed. So like the home screen clock and no option to change it.. did not like Bixby... and when I finally set the whole phone up I just slipped it into my front pocket and walked from the kitchen to living room and took it out.. didn't even sit down with in the pocket and the upper left corner was cracked. Returning it. Staying with my galaxy7
1045,5,"Fast, customizable, intuitive. Either ready-to-use out of the box or endless features and customization. Best electronic device I have used; phones, tablets, computers, gaming; this phone rules them all!"
1046,4,I like the phone it does lots of things. Good reviews on YouTube
1047,5,"I am very happy with the phone I got although I did not get the color I had ordered. I have a case on the phone so it really doesn't matter. It is very efficient, fast, and easy to use. The phone fits nicely in my hand. I was going to get the S8+, but I think it would have been to big so I am happy I went with the smaller version. I have a ton of apps and plenty of memory. I also like that I can see that I have missed calls, texts, emails, etc. without having to ""open"" the phone. It shows right on the screen while in sleep mode. The volume is more than adequate. The display is easy to read. There is still a lot I haven't discovered on the phone, but I keep finding out new stuff every day which excites me."
1048,5,I was enthralled with my old S5-Active. But this S8 is simply incredible!
1049,2,"When texting auto correct continues to put words on that are not even close to what you typed. For a 15 word text I have to manually correct at least 50% of the words. It's a real problem!! I've had it back to At&t several times, they have no idea what to do. I think I should be able to get a new phone replacement at no charge. This phone is great in every other way. Love it!!"
1050,5,I got this phone for my husband for his Birthday He loves it easy to use and very fast
1051,5,"Replaced my S4 with the S8. More speed, more user-friendly, more everything! Completely satisfied!"
1052,5,Love all my Samsung phones. I doubt I will go back to a iPhone. There is so much I can do with the layout and personal designs to my phone. The camera is much better as well
1053,5,Excellent phone. Samsung pay works even on conventional card readers not equipped the Apple pay/ Android pay. Screen is the best available on the market. Battery life is outstanding. Also works with voice over lte and high definition calling
1054,5,"Love this phone, fantastic screen, battery life, expandable memory... too much to remember. I would recommend this phone to everyone."
1055,5,I love it the moment i got it
1056,5,Love the phone awesome camera
1057,5,I bought this phone for my wife for mothers day. This phone replaced her 6 edge. She simply loves it. The camera is amazing.
1058,3,Not as good as you wished
1059,5,"Love my new phone! Wonderful pictures, easy to use."
1060,4,It's good. Battery don't last long.
1061,5,This one is faster than any others I have had before.
1062,5,Better feel when holding the phone and the larger screen is very nice
1063,4,The phone overal is great but the edges look just feels weird and isn't comfortable on the hands
1064,5,Love the rounded screen and fast speed
1065,5,What is really sad is it is expensive. Wish someone would make a competing phone so maybe then the price would come down. Is there anyone LG? HTC?
1066,5,Better phone than s7 takes better pictures
1067,5,"smooth and sleek, easy to use. Great features, nice camera."
1068,5,Omg so in love with this phone and it's features. Learning and loving this phone.
1069,5,Great phone love it! They did an awesome job!
1070,4,Like the phone. Still learning all the features. Has a great battery life.
1071,5,Awesome phone. So happy to get rid of the iphone7
1072,5,GREAT SO FAR A LOT OF NEW THINGS IT CAN DO.
1073,5,The phone is awesome it can do multiple things
1074,4,"Loved everything about the phone, especially the battery life, except for....the edge design. Hated that."
1075,4,the product is working fine and i love it
1076,5,Love love love it! Never want anything but samsung! This is my 4th one!
1077,4,"Good phone, zooms right along, fast charging. But hard to open phone most the times, the hold after 2 taps doesn't work most times. But clicking side button wakes it up. anoying! Unable to hear while on phone volume doesn't work, must put all calls on speeker"
1078,5,The s8 amazing it's so many different feathers on the phone
1079,5,"S8 edge phone is great,so easy to use and has lots more apps,great #love the s8 phone."
1080,5,Just had this a week but impressed so far. It has more memory than any other phone ive had.... better color too
1081,5,"Great phone! Was going to get the S-7, but decided to wait till the 8 came out. Glad I did."
1082,3,I really like the phone and sevice provider
1083,4,"SO, I like the phone, but it is hard to get super excited about it, seems about the same as always. I liked my BB Priv, and the S8 is perfectly fine, superb in fact, the only complaint I have is the electronic keyboard, it just doesn't respond like I would like, maybe it is just me though."
1084,4,Nice phone. Great camera. Easy to use. So light and thin. One downfall is it drops calls. My old phone never did that. This one does it constantly.
1085,4,the new phone was as good as expected except for 2 things. 1 being the new charging cord and there is no cover over the plug in
1086,5,"Not sure why some people talk badly about it, it's a great phone. Upgraded from the S7. I think a bunch of dissatisfied IPhone users are just bad mouthing something that's a whole lot better than the Iphones"
1087,5,Really satisfied with the galaxy S8
1088,5,So far thjos.phone seems great. Haven't navigated much to learn everything it does yet but plan too.
1089,5,Phone is by far the best galaxy I've had yet I started with the s4 active the note then s5 active and now this.. love it Samsung is the way to go
1090,5,"Love my phone, it's very handy and convenient for me"
1091,5,"Love it, love it, love it, can't put it down!!"
1092,4,Battery doesn't stay charge Plays music out of no where
1093,5,This phone makes everything so easy to learn.
1094,5,This is my third Galaxy S phone. It is amazing.
1095,4,"Battery life is great, but it would be better without the curved edge."
1096,5,The S8 is a more elegant than the iPhone. It does more. It allows me to set up the phone as I want it. I love it. I have been an Apple user for 22 years. It is possible to leave the mothership. I'm proof of that. Goodbye Apple.
1097,4,Love the camera.. Love the phone
1098,5,Phone is graet. Love it. U should get on too.
1099,5,"The Iphone 7+ is a good phone but the S8 is truly amazing. . . can't believe I'm saying that about a galaxy. Fast, snappy and the camera blows 7+ out of the water. Battery life is finally able to keep up a full 12 hours of hard use."
1100,5,Simply the best phone by far. Loving it :)
1101,1,I do not like this phone. I had it in my pocket with something else and the screen protector cracked. Replaced it and it has another crack in it. They need to do something different
1102,5,I love my new phone it really have lot great new features!!
1103,4,"Great phone. Very easy to manage. I do miss a few features that were on my old phone, but nothing I can't adjust too."
1104,4,"Its good, but there are some things to not like. The Bixby button is in the way and Bixby doesn't work anyway. The finger print scanner is in an awkward location and so far I find the face recognition to be less than effective. What light you are in seems to make a big difference. I also hate that I hate that I must open an email to delete it, unlike my nexus 5x on which I could just swipe an email away without opening it."
1105,5,Phone is great! It works just as I expected.
1106,5,"I have been truly impressed with the new Samsung Galaxy S8. It feels great in my hand. It very easy to read from It is incredibly responsive both to the touch and in changing sites. And, of course, the screen and picture on it are outstanding. I an a Samsung guy. This just helps me to stay one."
1107,4,I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks. So still getting used to the new features. Don't know for sure if I like or use the edge screen or folders. Still a lot of preloaded apps that I'll never use and can't take off. Disappointed I can't get a screen cover that will work with a case.
1108,1,Data issues immediately. Tech dept. Is going to get back to me.
1109,5,"If you are looking up this phone for reviews then you already have heard that it is a pretty good phone. I bought the S8 after a lot of research and anticipation but I was still blown away by everything that the phone offers. You cannot beat the clarity of the screen, the battery life impresses me every day, and the speed makes every other phone I touch seem painfully slow."
1110,4,"Nice phone. Was worried about all the glass but not a problem. Love the fingerprint reader, works great."
1111,3,Nice phone but wireless charger does not work
1112,4,"Love the phone, EXCEPT, no infrared to use tv remote apps. That sucks, and now I have to carry my 5S as well."
1113,5,I.LOVE.IT! :)------------
1114,5,Not since the HTC M1 have I been this impressed with with a new flagship phone. I love everything about this device.
1115,4,No regrets about this phone
1116,5,"Finely Samsung has hit it out of the park with this new S8, Simply outstanding not buggy i'm believeable pictures"
1117,5,I haven't found anything negative about it yet. The camera takes beautiful clear pictures. It has plenty of memory. I just lover it.
1118,2,"Had the Galaxy S5 and thought it was time to uograde. The S8 has a larger screen and takes good pictures but honestly I think the S5 is every bit as good and in fact I like its size better. In my personal opinion I wish I had stayed with the S5 instead of dishing out the money for a new phone. THEN, I'm having trouble finding instructions on how to use the features on the S8. There doesn't seem to be a manual for it. I admit I'm up in years and don't understand all that I should, but I don't recommend the S8 over the S5. I will say that the AT&T staff has really been courteous."
1119,5,"We all know what's great about the phone by now and it is fantastic. There is only one thing I have found thus far that annoys me, the bixby button. I hit it all the time on accident and it lights up the phone even when locked. I'm hoping this will be fixed. The only button that should light up a locked phone should be there power button. I was worried about the location of the fingerprint scanner and every review seems to say the same thing, ""it's awkward to reach"". I have not found this to be true in my case. Not only has it been convenient, it's been super responsive, fast and reliable. With my s6, it was so inconvenient because it would constantly take several attempts to unlock with a fingerprint, the s8 doesn't seem to suffer from this. I have no issues with the location or accuracy. I really have nothing but praise for this phone. If not for that pesky bixby button, it would be flawless. This is only my second Samsung phone having owned cell phones since 2003 and generally updating annually, this is far and away the best I've ever owned. I'm glad I hung onto my Galaxy s6, nothing compelled me to give it up until the s8. No regrets."
1120,5,Needed to get used to it but I really like it
1121,5,Best cell phone I ever owned.
1122,2,"The curved edge makes it a little difficult to tap anything that might be on that edge. The other big issue with this phone so far, is that the Gadget Guard protective cover that AT&T sells for it will not stay on and can be broken with literally NO effort. I have had several now and can flip them off with my finger nail. They do not seat down to the phone's face, only a light adhesive around the edges. And when the cover is on, you can not tap the phone easily because it doesnt make contact with the face of the phone. Over all I would say the phone and protector are a bad design."
1123,5,Love it!! Battery could last longer but phone is great!!!
1124,5,"Phone is Amazing , no buttons beside the ones on the sides it's a beautiful phone , worth the preordering and money ."
1125,4,"Love my galaxy 8. It does have problems downloading media pictures however, I'm hoping it's a software issue."
1126,5,I must say I have no complaints about this phone.
1127,5,Easy to use with a larger screen.
1128,5,Very excellent phone with good battery life that doesn't get hot. Very good battery life also.
1129,5,Is good. Me like Me think you like too
1130,5,Everything about this phone is awesome.
1131,3,I pre-ordered the S-8 and didn't know how much I disliked the curved screen until I got it in my hand. I took it back to the store the next day and paid the re-stocking fee. I'll keep my S-6 longer.
1132,2,"Pros: - Great Features - ""Ok Google"" is a great feature when i drive and need to message someone , or google a phone number. - Great quality Cons - It takes literally forever to Charge, I've done some research and I'm not the only one. - The finger print button is in a bad place, kinda hard to use - Battery doesn't really last that long, I really hate the fact the phone takes forever to charge even with the speed charger that it comes with - phone some times unlocks in my pocket.. - phone easily slips out of my hands.."
1133,5,"Constantly getting the ""DQA has stopped working"" message. Im unable to get rid of it. I've tried the recommendations, except the one we need tro purchase to get rid of the message. We shouldn't have to pay fix this issue. Otherwise, love the phone, the videos and pictures, excellent"
1134,5,Nice camera and screen quality. Battery has great life. Happy 100%.
1135,2,Only a baby or capuchin monkey could type o this phone c u need tiny fingers. It's located to use and for the most I should be able o take pictures and not have so many spelling errors.
1136,5,"This upgrade from my old HTC One M8 has been awesome, everything from the camera to the design and color, and it's fast in everything I do, even the charging speed is amazing! Couldn't be happier."
1137,4,The phone is great but the screen is very sensitive. You butt dial a lot. Make sure you get a glass screen protector
1138,5,"The phone has all the functionality you can imagine, easy to use and best camera I've ever had on a phone. AT&T as a carrier provides connectivity everywhere and anywhere I need. The retail customer service folks made it truly a seamless effort in getting the best deal and seating me and my son up for success with our account. Great experience!"
1139,4,"Overall a great phone. The camera has all kind of new and good features and takes more true pictures especially sunsets. However, the lower mega pixels does not allow as much zooming as before which is disappointing."
1140,5,Love it best phone I ever had.
1141,5,A very nice phone. Has many new gadgets
1142,5,So far phone is working great had minor problems with a Wi-Fi update but got it done
1143,4,Love the Samsung Galaxy 8!
1144,5,"Camera is nice, infinity screen is nice. I'm a Samsung fan, so it's great!!"
1145,5,I had a Nexus 6 for two years and loved it. Only got the S8 because the Nexus was slowing down. I am blown away by the S8. Highly recommended!
1146,2,Galaxy s 6 is better want galaxy back
1147,5,"I, am a nerd. I am a phone nerd. I am THE phone nerd. I've owned every iPhone and Android made (seriously, had 7 android just last year), and this phone is the best ever. Highly recommended"
1148,5,"Beautiful phone, love the big screen. The iris scanner works great."
1149,5,"The S8 is a huge upgrade from my S4, I love it The battery life lasted a long time. I can play my Spotify all day at work and still have a 70% charge at the end of the day."
1150,5,I have been buying galaxy phones since the Vibrant. This is the best one yet. No complaints here
1151,5,"This phone is really amazing.Nice specs,fast and CAMERA is very clear"
1152,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 exceeded expectations in looks, operation and functionally. It replaced a two year old Galaxy S6. Set-up was easy and the software interface was much improved. Port over of settings and files from old phone was fast and easy."
1153,5,"This is the best Galaxy everything !!! Smart,confortable and precisioner technology. Forever...the best !!!!"
1154,5,Great phone! I love the upgrades and the infinity screen.
1155,5,the s8 is killer! upgraded from the S6
1156,4,The rounded edges make it very important that you find the right screen protector. Even with that - it lifted up with the case for a few days. Fingertip sensor on the back is the worst change. Right next to the camera and it's not a natural way to hold your hand. But face and eye recognition means I don't have to deal with that. Battery lasts much longer. Overall happy with the phone. I upgraded from the Samsung 5.
1157,4,"The Galaxy S8 is very fast and a very pretty phone. I like how thin it is compared to my old 6S plus. I am not fond of the fingerprint being on the back of the phone, it's just awkward. I think all in all it will be an upgrade over my iPhone."
1158,5,"Love my new GS8. Great phone with nice features. Love the camera and the apps. Charges quickly. Battery does go down fast depending on usage. Otherwise, I think this is a great phone."
1159,5,GREAT PHONE n I will recommended to I know
1160,1,"I was iPhone user for ten years and I never had any connection problem, wifi or making a call, I just switched to Samsung and wifi is disconnecting so many times consuming my data. I tried everything I found on forums but no solution yet. :("
1161,4,Awesome phone HATE I BIXBY and there should be some kind of touch config have to type real hard
1162,5,"Love the phone so far, longer battery life. Camera has always taken great photos."
1163,5,"Samsung Galaxy S8 appears to be all that was promised. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market looking to upgrade. My husband purchased the S8+ which is also a great phone but it if he could do it again he would not get the S8+ phone which is just a little too large, the size of the S8 is much better"
1164,5,Was so glad to get a new phone. This phone does just what I need.
1165,5,"Pros: infinity display, display takes up most of screen, outstanding performance, no lag, dual Bluetooth connection with bt 5.0, dual quad core processors, camera way better than iPhone 7, more real tone pictures, fingerprint unlock without pushing home button first, etc... Cons: speaker needs integrated, notification bar needs integrated to a newer more futuristic look, needs more of an organized setting menu like marshmallow, needs a dedicated app or storage for contacts like AT&T used to have but did away with, etc..."
1166,5,"This phone is great, I was worried about the curved screen because I've never had one before, but it is actually wonderful. The camera is great. The battery lasts for hours! I actually do not mind not having buttons at the bottom of the screen, the screen detects when you press where they would be and vibrates slightly to let you know it feels it. Not a bother at all. My only problem would be the fingerprint sensor, it only works about once every five times you try to use it. Sometimes it will not even work on certain fingers. It is slightly frustrating. Also, face recognition only recognizes me half of the time, if that. Other than the touchy biometrics, this phone is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone."
1167,3,"My S - 4 was just about as good as this phone , this thing locks up all the time , my S - 4 never locked up on me . If I was to do it over , the S - 8 would definitely not be in the top 3 or 5 phones to spend so much money on , don't really know what would be at this time !"
1168,5,I like it so far. It froze up one time I hope it doesn't happen again.
1169,5,I went from the S5 to this. I love everything about this phone.
1170,5,"I have only been using a couple of weeks, so still feeling my way around. I am concerned that I have not yet found the protective accessories I want. Right now I have my silver phone in a black case (back and edges) with only a sheet of film protecting the front screen. This defeats the purpose of the edge technology. The right case is probably out there. Just haven't' found it yet."
1171,4,Awesome display. Takes great photos. New to Samsung user format so took some getting use to but no problems as of yet with solfware
1172,4,"Easy to use, quick and nice feel."
1173,5,Really glad that I decided to up grade my phone. Love the ease of using it. The sleek design is awesome.
1174,5,I've had my phone for a week. Not one issue
1175,1,This is a soft cover that will not protect your phone from drops.
1176,5,Nice phone and wonderful phone to have a new phone that just came out.
1177,5,"Excellent service, fast shipping and awesome device."
1178,5,Best display available. Great cameras. Super fast.
1179,5,I think it's great. And easy to use.
1180,5,Great phone so far. Easy to use and fun!
1181,5,this phone make me happy i recommend
1182,5,"This phone is amazing, I upgraded from the galaxy S5. And I am really happy with my new product. The bigger screen feels and looks amazing especially when watching videos and playing games.The phone design is superb, battery and camera are even better."
1183,4,Seems to be a good phone great camera Bluetooth range not good
1184,5,Replaced an Apple 6 with this phone and I'll never go back! The Samsung is head and shoulders above the Apple.Easy to navigate through all the features
1185,5,Love this phone! This perfectly on your hand great battery life and I like the iris recognition to unlock it. Very satisfied with this phone!
1186,5,"I love my new Samsung galaxy 8 phone. The person who help me, her name is Wendy. She is very helpful, nice she k re what she was talking about. The location of the store is in South gate."
1187,4,"Over all the phone is like most others but has some really good features. The fact that the wireless charging does not work at all and the DQA keeps stopping error that keeps coming up has still not been completely fixed lowers my rating. As for recommending, NO. Can not recommend a product that does not provided what it offers."
1188,3,Well the phone cool. But now error message DQA stops working. Not so cool for brand new phone. Plus has red tint and full screen display got some issues. Hopefully update will fix these issues. Come on samsung get it together
1189,3,"Well, I like the speed and picture quality and how this the phone is. I'm not thrilled with the curves, frustrated. Makes. It difficult to type and make corrections. I got locked out of accounts because of not able to use the keys. Correctly as they are on the curves."
1190,5,"Great phone to have,Very important phone to have a great. I recommend this phone to all my family Thanks samsung......"
1191,5,"So far, love my S8. Camera is excellent, the battery lasts longer than the one in the S7, size is perfect, etc. Only drawback is the rounded edges when associated with the shiny and slick case. You need to have a rubber type case (non-slip)"
1192,5,I'm still learning about my phone and all it can do but I'm already impressed. The easy customization and ease of use are unparalleled in my experience! Quite pleased with the shape and design as well.
1193,5,Love the new S8 and the Orchid Gray is beautiful.
1194,4,"It's a cool phone still learning how to use it. First off the camera is amazing both front, and back. Love the large screen and that it's water proof, and can hold a SD card any GB size I want. The down side is I hate that I can't use it as my remote control for my tv and all my electronics in my house any more. The eye scanner dosent work all the time the finger print works some times and it makes you us your pin it can't make up it's mind what it wants to do so it gives you an error code and says sorry half the time but when it works it works well so that's something I would change I don't like that the fingerprint scanner is on the back of the phone it's hard to use."
1195,5,"I'm a long time Samsung Galaxy user, i started with the s4, and I absolutely adore this phone. I was a little weary about the lack of a physical home button, but found that even though it is on the screen it looks and feels the same way a real home button did. All in all, the phone feels like what i imagine it feels like to own a Cadillac. 10/10 would reccommend."
1196,5,"My last phone was a Samsung Galaxy S5 and I loved it! I had broken the camera on it so it was time for a new phone. I hated to see it go, but the new Galaxy S8 was a smooth transition. Many of the features from my old one are still there, but the new ones Samsung has added are wonderful. And transferring all of my contacts, apps., etc., was extremely easy. The camera takes great pictures and the speed of opening things is very quick. I love the S8 and highly recommend it."
1197,5,I've never pre ordered a phone before but I'm so happy I did
1198,5,"Love this phone, it is so slim. Camera is great, it takes really good pictures & easy to use. It also has a place for an SD card. Bixby is new & very helpful. Security has stepped up ...so many different ways to set it up."
1199,5,excellent features....excellent service...really impressed.
1200,5,Awesome best customer service .
1201,5,"Never had the edge galaxy phones before, and i'm glad i held out for this phone. it's thin, easy to hold and slide in and out of pockets. it processes fast and the battery life is amazing! hopefully i can say that in six months!"
1202,5,Best phone on the market and very easy to use!
1203,4,"Nice phone, when I can get it to wake up. Missed a phone call because it wouldn't wake up when the pholne rang. Swipe, tap, hit the home button, power button, and volume button... no dice. Happens about 50% of the time. Searched on google, other s8s are down oing the same thing."
1204,5,"I am in love with this phone. The orchids gray color is beautiful. The camera works great with a lot of added features like snapchat-like filters as well as moving pics. The screen is so crisp and clear. Just a gorgeous, well-designed phone. Battery life is awesome!"
1205,1,This phone is absolute junk.
1206,5,"Phone feels fantastic in the hand. Feels very solid/well-built. Screen is beautiful. Watching videos on this device is amazing. Upgraded from an S5 to the S8. I always get Otterbox Defenders when I buy a new phone, those cases have probably saved me thousands of dollars. The 5 was enormous in the case. Even in the Otterbox, the 8 fits into my pocket easily. Much more narrow and thinner. UI works very well. Very responsive. I haven't noticed any lag. I don't have any issues with the finger print scanner location. Camera produces awesome pictures."
1207,3,I love the screen In the size of the phone in the apps that are easily-accessible
1208,5,"I like the Microsoft phone OS and I had hoped they would be serious about smart phones, but after plodding along with my MS 950 for a year and a half, I gave up and made the leap to Android and the Samsung S8. Wow what a difference. This is one impressive phone. I had pre-ordered it and have had it several days now. Everything worked right out of the box. It is quick on all fronts...OS, connectivity, battery charging. A great display and easily customizable organization. And the battery easily lasts a full day with decent usage. So far I am very happy with it. The only complaint is that I feel I have to put a case on it. While it is a great form-factor, the back is slippery and video tests on YouTube show it to be breakable if dropped. That kind of hides the beauty and feel of the body. Oh well."
1209,2,"Samsung, Google, and A.T all T. have apps going on this thing. I disabled all the automatic updates, yet something called ""launcher"" updated on its own. Still don't know what it was. After that, the phone froze up, I had 20 apps disappear and it kept restarting in a loop. I also couldn't get any of the recognition software to work. I think that was part of the issue as well, because the screen it would freeze on was my lock pattern screen/face recognition screen (which never worked!). So back it went to the store. Don't know if I'll try another one. Hope this one was just a lemon. Also, the phone has way too much stuff on it, and that's b/c of the 3 different brands competing on this phone. All the Samsung junk, the Google junk (that you need), and the loaded A.T and T bloatware. If iPhone had Swipe, I'd probably get one."
1210,5,Left apple for this and it was a good choice
1211,3,I love it except for the DQA error once you guys put a fix for that it will be a five but until that error stops popping up it is a 3
1212,4,"The messaging on the S8 doesn't work as previous releases of Galaxy phones. When you message on the S8, and you do an attachment, it changes it to two text messages instead of 1 in previous versions. This makes the message look weird to the people receiving it. I think this should be fixed and returned back to the way it was in prior Galaxy versions."
1213,3,I love the device however I may have to return it. Device constantly reboots at random times. I exchanged my first one and the new one has the same issue. Surprised nobody is mentioning this failure. Hope they fix it with an update soon.
1214,4,"Great phone. Love the infinity screen look to it. At first I thought that you couldn't use the old charging ports either but you can. In the box there is a small adapter included. One end plugs into the new charger port and goes into the phone and the other fits the old port types. We have a lot of the old chargers as well and at first I was annoyed by that until I discovered the adapter. Not really sure why they would change it, but pretty cool it at least came with the adapter."
1215,5,Great phone!! Camera is amazing!! My only complaint is Samsung changed the charging port on the Galaxy 8 so none of our other car chargers/any charger used for the 7 work on this phone!!
1216,5,"The S8 was an easy choice going from the 7 Edge because they're approximately the same size. The screen is taller but narrow which allows a better hold & more to see. The biometric security features such as fingerprints, face recognition & iris scan are flawless & have no delay. The camera front & back deliver great pictures & video as well as have countless preloaded filters for your disposal. The Edge & split screen feature adds to my convenience as I'm sure it being waterproof will but my 8 won't be going in any water. The battery balances out even with it's performance. Overall I'm pleased & can say it's put together quite well."
1217,5,Love it it's a great phone
1218,5,"This phone is simply amazing at first look, and when it comes to performance it backs up its looks. Amazing camera for pretty much any shot or video you take in pretty much any type of lighting conditions. Great features and love the new change up with the interface and/or theme presence. Only small knock is battery life but people have to remember this is a powerful device that is going to take a lot of power to run it. not to mention which has always been a knock on android devices for me is the amount of bloatware androids come stocked with..technically this phone packs 75% more power than an Iphone 7 but due to the all the bloatware Iphones benchmark almost comprable. But trust me comparing this phone to an iphone is like comparing a buick saturn to a porsche."
1219,5,"Call a vet cause this puppy is sick!! sleek, solid, comfortable, fast, brite, this is one awesome cellular unit!!"
1220,1,Battery life is still subpar.
1221,5,"Great phone, lightweight, beautiful design and display. If i need to add anything to this phone i would say ""nothing"". The future of the phones is here and now!"
1222,5,I preordered my Galaxy S8 in the Orchid Gray and I absolutely LOVE it! Lightweight and easy to navigate.
1223,1,"I've noticed that battery life is draining really fast on this phone. I've took in to service center and they've replaced the battery and even factory reset as they've suggested. now its worse than before. first 30 minutes of Facebook usage drains 15% of battery. note, I make sure there are no other apps running in the background. with 100% battery Charge, I get about 18 hrs usage estimates.(actually less than that). since battery was replaces and reset yet still having an issue. I think issues this phone, may be it's from bad batch. I've notified but not sure what Samsung will do."
1224,4,I am enjoying my phone the S6 is a nice phone the camera is amazing that picture is amazing the phone is wonderful that's what I need read out voicemail and all that
1225,2,"The Galaxy S6 edge does not keep a charge, it takes a long time to charge. I've had this phone for a little more than a month and it has frozen up on me twice and it's not that easy to reboot the phone. I have taken my phone off the charge at 100% and laid it down with no usage and the charge dropped to 60% in less than 3 hours. This is the worst Samsung ever. All other Samsungs that I've had have been great. I'm very disappointed with this 1. It was sent to me thru the insurance as a replacement for the S5 I had. Truly a waste."
1226,4,"It is a very pretty phone, camera is so cool and does all that the android phone is supposed to do , bad side is that it has a lag sometimes battery runs out vety fast ehen used for work pueposes, ai had to lower display brightnes deactivate amoled features, deactivate a whole bunch of services and many other things including usimg battery life saving features creating a lag on the phone to get close to what my old nexus 5 battery life does using all the features. compared to my old nexus 5 it has a lower perfomance and as mentioned battery life :( it is a very pretty phone though... Not bad, not good... it is an android phone.. :/"
1227,5,"Do you want a phone with the ruggedness of a Lifeproof or Otterbox Case? Do you want the battery life that can last more than 12 hours with heavy usage? Want a screen that’s beautiful but not made of the cheapest glass someone can glue onto a frame? Those and so much more? Then I think the Galaxy S8 Active is for you. The battery life of the S8 Active is nothing short of great. It has a 4000 mAh battery that even with playing games and going on youtube for hours, I still have more than 50% battery within 12 hours. If you just keep this in your pocket and use it to listen to music, respond to texts here and there along with a few calls, this battery should easily last you a day if not more. For durability, it’s true, the raw screen itself is prone to scratches, but it’s definitely shatter/crack proof. I’ve dropped this thing on metal surfaces at a gym a few times and there are both no scratches and no cracks of any sort. The phone has a pretty rubber back with a metal frame with super-sturdy construction. If tight pants and phones don’t make a good combo, it’ll probably be because the pants break first. The only thing this thing needs to be really safe from any long-term exposure to wear and tear is a dedicated anti-scratch screen protector. Although in 1 year the phone may perform perfectly, the scratches on the screen may make it look like a 3 - 4 year old phone. The Cameras are great. The Back camera can go up to 12 mega pixels with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and 9.1 mega pixels with a 9:1 aspect ratio. The front facing camera can go up to 8 mega pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3. The displace can scale from 1480x720, 2220x1080 and 2960x1440. I use 2220x1080, and the great detail for any application, videos, game, regular use, is way more for me than needed to satisfy my detail crave. Connectivity is standard but still good on this phone. You have a SIM/micro SD card slot in a form like the apple phones, a USB C port and something Apple phones lack, a 3.5 mm audio slot. Connecting to a PC is much easier compared to my old phone. The old phone I had would connect and disconnect from PC’s when trying to transfer files which got annoying to no end. But the OS on the S8 Active (probably same as the regular S8) allows you to easily switch connectivity modes to fix anything if you can’t transfer files correctly the first time. Processing power on this thing is great. It’s got a Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 835 with 8 CPU cores. For most modern applications at the writing of this review, there isn’t much I can throw at it that it can’t go through easily. You can play games and multi-task at the expense of some battery life, but you can definitely do it. I’ve had no real problems with this phone, just amazement and satisfaction. If you just want a phone without needing to deal with a case and can take the blow of sacrificing the regular S8’s curved corner screen, then this phone is a serious must get."
1228,4,"After about 6 months my wife's phone, which was also a s7 active, was very glitchy to the point of almost being unusable. For example it was very slow to load anything, restarted on its own, apps that worked great stopped working, etc. I have had the S7 Active for a little over a year now and it was a great phone when I first got it. I loved this phone easily the best phone I have had, it looked great, was fast, ran like dream. But now that it is a year old its not so great anymore, mainly being its glitchy, slow, apps have issues running now, some apps barely work. What is sad to me is my old Galaxy Note 3, yes the beloved note 3, almost works better and runs more smoothly than my S7 Active now. Unfortunately I will likely have to upgrade to a new phone soon because the problems are slowly getting worse with each new update and patches. Sorry Samsung but when I get a new phone I will most likely get someone else's product."
1229,5,The best phone ever!!! Durable and up to speed with all the technological advances. Color is great quality.
1230,5,"Best display ever, great battery and performance ."
1231,1,"I just received the device this week and due to the smooth surfaces, it slipped and fall on floor. I did not realize this earlier, even the back has some glass coating, which cracked. Not sure what's the point of glass on the back. That was not the case with the Samsung S7. Why would you have glass all around. The Speaker is placed at the right hand bottom corner, which is usually where I hold my phone and it gets blocked. I have to keep adjusting my hand and that make it a little difficult to hold it. The earphone is smaller, so unless you hold it correctly I cannot hear the caller at all. Another problem, their Gray looks like Blue. Not sure if it is just how it is. We are checking with Customer Service to see if this the right color though."
1232,5,"I've had this phone for over a year and have never had a problem with it. I had the S6 edge+ and thought the S7 was a down grade, then you came out with the S8 and the S8+. I buy nothing but Samsung and will never use anything else! All the updates just make it that much better!"
1233,4,This phone is very good compared to other phones I've had I'm pleased with your warranty service and your repair to my device I would recommend this device to anyone and I would encourage them to purchase another galaxy my Samsung that's all I have for now thank you
1234,5,"Every Samsung product I've used, performance exceeded my expectation."
1235,2,"IVE HAVE SAMSUNG PHONES FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. I HAVE HAD THE GALAXY S8+ FOR 5 MONTHS NOW AND IM READY TO GET RID OF SAMSUNG PHONES.ITS SO SLOW, KEYBOARD IS SLOW, APPS ALWAYS CRASH. I WOULDNT RECCOMEND."
1236,5,I love how the pictures come out so clear. The timer features for the camara are awesome. I love that i can split the screen in case am doing 2 things at the same time
1237,1,Doesn't update email. Doesn't hold a charge you can never silence the key pad. I literally can go on and on about this sad excuse for a phone what a disappointment.
1238,4,"Product works well, only wish it didn't come with Bixby."
1239,4,Its an amazing phone in general but I'm having troubles with the battery life where it discharges way too quickly in a span of ten minutes. It can go to 60 from 100 after not using it and just walking around for a while. I wish I could get it fixed but overall good phone.
1240,5,The S8 is awesome overall people complain about the finger prints scanner but I think its fine besides the S9 is gonna have a pressure fingerprint scanner on the infinity screen.
1241,4,"This is really a good phone. At the time I got it probably the best phone on the market. I was m weigh alo to with my phone purchases and an not into gimmicks. The OS way great at the beginning, it's still good but Samsung has changed a few things that made it not quite as good as it was originally. Bixby feels a little forced at times and it can be difficult to escape Samsung's sales team. I have cracked my phone twice, even with an OtterBox. Bluetooth tends to be sketchy at times. Having to reconnect devices that have already been connected recently. I realize content can be lucrative but people on Samsung devices are not looking for an apple experience per se. The one on the negative I would have to say about the phone is the headphone jack does not hold eighth inch connectors very well."
1242,4,"The Galaxy S8 64GB (TracFone) Overall is Terrific for being the least expensive Galaxy S8. With the 2.45GHz CPU 4GB RAM Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Processor and the OS Android 7.0 Nougat it's Performance & Features is High-Tech. See the Cyber World tnrough it's Beautiful 5.8"" Edgeless HD Display. And with additional features such as the Iris Scanner, Fingerprint Sensor & Samsung KNOX that provides RGB, Proximity & Geomagnetic Sensors to garuntee your Phones Privacy and Protection. But Aside from the High End Performance and Features, the Galaxy S8 is like a Butterfly.. Beautiful at site, but Some what Fragile to the touch(Figure Of Speach). With having a Front & Back Glass screen I highly recommend Getting a phone case ASAP. And I'd also recommend Getting Samsung+ Protection to cover accidental damages."
1243,2,I bought this phone back in May and I loved it since yesterday. Yesterday on Thanksgiving I was really busy and I forgot to charge my phone and it went completely dead on me. I had placed it on the charger and nothing happened it just remained dead. I tried troubleshooting it and still nothing the phone just remains dead and I'm now without a phone. Good thing I have insurance but I had to come out of pocket to cover the deductible even though this issue is not my fault. I did nothing to my phone except not charge it and this is just ridiculous!
1244,1,"Had Samsungs Galaxys since S3 came out. From S5 to S8 Samsung created inferior products. Only S3 and S4 were really good phones. Just got my S8, dropped it in the water and got the bubbles, which means it wasn't factory sealed well. Of course, next day it dies. You just can't ADVERTISE that "" it is water-resistant in up to 5 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. "" when the phone brakes immediately once you drop it in the water. Same thing happened with S6 active, S7 Active. I was ready to make the move to iPhone but I wanted to give Samsung one more chance with the S8. Again, I was disappointed."
1245,5,"I can't even call it a phone, because it does so much more. The phone has been great so far ... lots of features and lots of great photos. Plus, the browsing seems much faster, no matter what site I visit. Jury is still out on Bixby, but I haven't really used it. Otherwise, I would recommend it."
1246,4,"Would rate the the phone is 8 out of the 10 Screen is awesome. Just wish the top and bottom bezels were a bit smaller. The OS is a bit cluttered and overly complex for my taste Battery is better then average and boy do I love the fast charging. Fingerprint reader is horrible compared to my iphone. Phone has stayed super fast and had no issues with multitasking or playing any games what so ever. Overall it is a great phone. Just not sure it is for me. I wish the home button would be able to permanently stay on screen and love the tweak ability of the phone. And it seems to be a high quality, well built phone that will last years to come."
1247,4,"I find the S8+ to be a very good phone, screen is large and pretty clear. After having had the iphone for many years, I was ready to try something new. I have decided It's a bit cluttered for my taste, though. Finger print reader is a little awkward to use. I find the battery life is about average. I don't think you can go wrong picking this phone. It all boils done to preference. I really can't find anything negative to say about this phone."
1248,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is the best phone on the market. The battery life is amazing! It lasts all day and charges really fast! I've been using Android phones for years. But when the phones battery became non-removable I had to switch to an iPhone because my battery would drain before noon. It doesn't make sense to have a fancy phone that you can't use! As always, the screen resolution is crystal clear! Everything is vivid when I am watching a movie or going through my photos. My only wish is that they make the fingerprint reader in a more accessible location, like the Nexus 6P, but otherwise the phone is flawless."
1249,2,"this product is awesome, I will recommend this. Its very good."
1250,1,I know the phone is not a edge phone and that's ok but i don't like the way they changed the front of the phone around.
1251,5,The S8 is very dleek and the display is amazing. Battery life is greaf and the speed of the phone is by far the best yet!
1252,5,This is easily the best phone ever. The battery life is excellent and Bixby is great and was well worth the wait. My only major complaint is that the earbuds didn't live up to the hype and didn't last 2 months before one side went out. This is an amazing phone despite the price tag and the fingerprint sensor placement isn't that bad.
1253,3,"I would be in love with this phone if it would stop freezing up and shutting itself down. So far today, it has frozen up 5 times."
1254,4,"My screen has a small crack in the upper left corner most likely that it may have dropped. Think the rounded off edges of the phone are too vulnerable when they hit something, suggest to enforce the corners in some way or another."
1255,5,"The best-looking phone around crushes it in performance, battery life, water-resistance and wireless charging. An external storage slot lets you keep more photos, videos and music. Honestly the statement above it just part of the features that this phone offers. I recently change to Samsung and I want to share my experience with all of you. Let's start with the design, the way Samsung made the S8+ it just amazing, very light weight, feels really nice on your hand and the screen design is just beautiful. Features: The camera is just a mine blower the quality of the pictures are just simply amazing, if you are addictive to your social media this phone will give you the best pictures for you to post in your media, make sure you use the ""selective focus"" feature on your phone for great results, if you are in a restaurant and want to share your favorite dishes with your friend make sure you use the ""Food "" feature on your camera for best resolution. Now let's talk about Bixby, you may have said who or what is that correct? well Bixby is like Siri but in a better way, no honestly it is... Bixby got a better respond and is really fast finding the things you need on the phone and on the web, also when you use Bixby Samsung give you XP points so you can use them to claim rewards in the Samsung store, that's pretty cool. The apps: I must have said that for some reason the apps work a lot better on this phone then the others. I believe the reason is because there are no restrictions on the app features. another cool features that this phone have is that it works well with any Microsoft apps like word, excel power point and outlook, is like having a window phone combine with android. You can also open your work attachment and modify them at the palm of your hand. Bluetooth: this feature allows you to connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at the same time. last but no least: the face recognition, the finger scanner and the Samsung pass features will ensure that your personal information, payments and online bills remain highly secure. These features will give you a peace of mine even if your ever loss your phone. Well I hope this information is helpful and somehow help you to decide what's your new phone is going to be in my personal opinion I don't have any regrets, the Samsung s8+ offers the best technology out there as now. Thank you all and best of luck."
1256,5,This is by far the best phone I've ever had. Pros: The pictures it takes are amazing and are even clear at night. The phone itself looks amazing and the screen is very big. Cons: the curved screen makes glass screen protectors hard to keep on. The size of the standard S8 seems more attractive being just a little smaller.
1257,5,"I wanted to test the phone in different conditions to have a fair assessment on how it handles different circumstances. So far I have to admit, the phone is outstanding in regards to hardware, having the 6.2 inch display in a phone that could easily be used with one hand is a work of art. The battery easily lasts a full day with heavy use. Camera access is fast and bixby is really useful if you take the time to learn to utilize it. Also being able to split screen two apps is really useful, many might not think of it as unique since Android 7.0 implemented it into most devices, but the thing that isn't emphasized on is when you do split let's say maps and Spotify on other devices maps stops updating your navigation if you accessing Spotify and vice versa, whereas on Samsung's software both apps are always updating and running. I was also on the fence between this phone and the Note 8 but the smaller size and longer battery seemed to be more useful day to day features than the S-pen and dual rear OIS cameras. These are just an overview of my experiences since having the phone, only thing that needs to be adjusted is bixby lagging a bit after launching due to the new update, but it's a minor glitch in all honesty."
1258,5,"This phone has been my everything for the past 3 months and through the good (and sometimes bad) I have found that this beauty has outperformed my other devices and has left my table and other smartphone in the dust. The screen is bigger on the plus, but that's just the tip of the infinity display. The screen is super sharp, the colors pop, and most importantly having the screen on and active does not kill your battery. I found myself watching movies on this device, balancing spreadsheets, popping open one note, and actually playing games. Some of the cooler things about this iteration of the Samsung's flagship phone is the google assistant and bixby combo. Some people aren't a Bixby fan, but used in conjunction with google assistant, its pretty useful and to be honest, its pretty cool. I am able to open all native apps, schedule upcoming events, add alarms, take notes, and a plethora of other day to day tasks using Bixby and Google assistant. The unlocked S8+ allows for less bloatware, but buyer beware (here comes the bad) the unlocked phone does not support wireless calling or data while the phone is in use. These things are service provider specific and unfortunately Samsung has not been able to add these items to an unlocked device. That minor annoyance does not take away from the functionality of the phone. I still talked a plenty, played tons of games, and managed work on this gorgeous piece of equipment even with the software limitations/restrictions. The battery life on this device is outstanding, far surpassing my s7. The camera is also outstanding and the ease of connecting with other Samsung devices (think Gear S2, Gear 360) has improved. The S8+ is sleek, has plenty of wow factor, and most importantly functions amazing. I have left my tablet behind on many occasions because this phone easily replaces it."
1259,5,"I recently purchased the Galaxy S8+. Right from the start it was easy to use, I also found it easy to move all my contacts and media from my old Samsung S5. Watching videos and looking at media is great with the edge to edge screen and the battery life is great. I would fully recommend it to my friends and family."
1260,5,"Upgraded from a fairly old phone (the Nexus 5), so this was a huge leap to the next generation for sure! The photos it takes completely rivals any other phone I've seen (including my husband's S7!) and not to mention it even seems sharper than my friends' iPhone pics. The phone, albeit on the large side, has an absolutely GORGEOUS screen and makes browsing and interacting an absolute pleasure every time I fire it up. Only drawback is that it's very difficult for one handed operations, but I'm not going to ding the number of stars for that because I knew what I was getting myself signed up for when purchasing such a large phone."
1261,5,"Samsung Galaxy S8+ Phone Review: Bigger Screen, Better Phone? After an embarrassing setback with the Galaxy Note 7, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is promising to be a bigger and better phone you'll be proud to have. The smaller version, the Galaxy S8 has been a homerun for the company and they're hoping with a bigger screen, comes a better experience and a much-loved phone. Does it live up to hype? Let's find out in this review. Design and Build: Samsung phones have come a long way. Whereas the company initially developed phones with high end plastic, for the S8+, they've made sure to echo a more sophisticated look and quality by using a combination of glass and metal in its build. Overall Verdict: So is the Samsung S8+ worth considering if you're in the market for a new smartphone? The answer is a definite yes! If you love extra large screens, this one wins hands down. It's not too bulky but taller instead, the screen resolution is wonderful and will make you wonder why you even need a tablet at all. The aesthetics is sleek and beautiful without compromising on the quality or the function of the piece. I also love the iris scanner and camera quality. I just wish they had found a better placement for the fingerprint scanner because really, it renders a good scanner useless because of its awkward positioning. However, if there's one thing to rave about with the S8+, it's the battery life. I've never seen a phone last this long and I'm sure in the future, this is just going to get better."
1262,5,It’s a great phone. It’s way better than the competitors. I recommend it 100%
1263,5,"I am so impressed with my S8 plus. I love how the screen feels so smooth, big enough for what I want and the clarity of the pixels, terrific. I have used it to record some live events and concert- it was so clear. I am very happy!"
1264,5,"I have always been a fan of Samsung products. When I first got the S8, I was excited. Samsung Galaxy S8. 5.8 inches of AMOLED screen with almost no bezel. The screen is in a 18:9 aspect ratio compared to the movie standard of 16:9 so basically you will not get 5.8 inches of screen when watching videos. There will be black bars on the left and right of the screen. There is an option to crop it to fit the whole screen though. No problems with the screen being hard to read outdoors in sunlight. There is a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone that works wonderful. I never felt that it was hard to reach the spot to get it to work. The exterior of the S8 is mostly a glossy glass which is a big finger print magnet and is slippery to hold. A good case will fix this. An annoying thing I find myself doing is always accidentally pressing the ""Bixby"" button when I was wanting to adjust the volume. There is no physical home button or the capacitive buttons like on previous galaxy phones. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen brings up the buttons. Alarm clock has a neat feature where it will ring and have a voice prompt giving you the time and weather for the day. The ""Always on"" screen while phone is in standby mode is a great feature where it displays the time, date, and other useful informations but only displays in portrait mode. Standing it up on the side of the phone will not rotate the clock. All in All.... The new S8 is a good upgrade with great features. Sleek, thin and light phone with the best in class screens makes it worth it."
1265,5,I absolutely love this new s8 The infinity display is amazing when it comes to watching my shows And when it comes to the camera the pictures are flawless Can't wait to discover more great featured and usages about this device
1266,4,"Pros: Everything -1 Cons: glass gets scratched to easily, nobody sells covers 4 it. I hope the company will allow is a discount on screen replacement.....going to need it! everythigelse ROCK'S"
1267,1,"I have spent 2 months, now, reading guides to JUST SET UP MY SETTINGS. It's impossible! I wanted to be able to give this phone a great review but, it's not really feasible. In all seriousness to disable notifications go to Settings > notifications Simple, right? Nope! Notification settings have 3 DIFFERENT pages of settings, that I have found, so far. Settings > Notifications Settings > Notifications > Advanced Settings Settings > Lock Screen and Security > Notifications Even still I receive notifications from apps with no permission to do so. Then, the icing on the cake, is that every hour certain apps GIVE THEMSELVES NOTIFICATION ACCESS! It's usually the apps that have notifications you can't swipe away. I have resigned myself to never being able to have a non-cluttered lock screen. Think about that and remember that Google Location keeps track of everywhere you go, and how you get there... sending it to a company famous for meticulously building a profile on YOU. ""So disable it, then!"" Well, other apps can remove my blockages so... Why the 1 stars? Features: You have to set up your features... and the settings are impossible to locate: it makes sense why google is so involved in this phone because, you're going to be Googling an awful lot to try setting this guy up. Performance: well, the settings are how you optomize performance... enough said. Design: The phone is capable of surviving an atomic bomb, it seems... and by the time you're done trying to configure it, you'll be begging to test that theory. The menus are part of program design and thus, all it's snazzy looks are outweighed by it's impractical layout. Value / Overall: the phone does whatever it wants and hides it's setting all over the place. It's like they started make menus and realized they forgot features on those menus. Instead of remaking the menu with all the relevant information in one place, they just kept adding menus. More than that half the menus are hats, on hats, on hats, with very little distinction between this menu or that... but hey the last menu didn't change anything so this one has to, right? Wrong. If you can't use it effectively it has no value."
1268,3,Camera has improved a lot. Performance is excellent. But screen is average in comparison to earlier model S6 edge plus. I am not sure on battery as battery performance can only be judged after 2 years in actual. I had a bad battery experience with my S6 edge plus battery so Samsung is really weak in battery area (Be aware if you use battery more). You have pay a huge service cost if battery goes bad even though it is not your fault. Also S6 phone design is far better than S8.
1269,4,"The phone overall is great. But the screen scratches easily. With the phone never being abused, the screen has scratches within 2 months of usage. Should have got a screen protector or since i came in from Moto Z force Samsung should have a replacement for the screen."
1270,5,"Nice upgrade from my LG G3 mini and Galaxy S5. Just about everything is perfect except for battery life, no micro SD and only 2 years of major OS upgrades."
1271,3,Difficult to hold phone without making unintended contact on the phone screen.
1272,5,"Best phone I've ever had! Screen and camera is BEAUTIFUL, power and volume buttons are mapped in good places, still has a headphone jack (apple can't give you that), my only complaint is the fingerprint scanners placement, but other than that, I do NOT regret my purchase, keep it up Samsung!!!"
1273,5,"Hi, I've had just about every Galaxy phone since the Galaxy S4, with that being said I have seen many changes both good and bad. I remember my S4 and S5 seemed almost indestructible compared to the s6 edge, s7 edge, note 7 and s8 plus, which all feel incredible in my hand but don't take a drop as well as they used to. Times change though and this s8 plus is the perfect size for me, I watch movies all the time at work. Picture quality is excellent, the device is fast and has never froze. Compared to my note 7 there are many similarities, the look and feel are very close, however we don't have the battery issue. This is also the largest s series phone Samsung has produced only .1 inches smaller than the Note 8. Unless you absolutely have to have the s pen this is basically the same phone, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who loves a good Samsung and has to have the best new smart phone on the market."
1274,1,"If you're considering a Samsung S8+ just know, my phone has terrible burn-in on the AMOLED screen. Just went a week without the phone while it went back to Samsung for repair. I got it back and there's dirt behind the screen. They now want the phone back again. Terrible customer service."
1275,2,Phone couldn't take one drop cracked screen from my work bench to the floor. Scratches from coins and or keys the first day I bought it
1276,5,Awesome phone. Love the IR feature. Love the layout too. Only thing is no SD card which is something I miss being able to keep my music on SD and playing it on my powered speaker. I don't like tying up my phone with Bluetooth connection to my powered speaker.
1277,4,i love the phone as a whole. though it took a while to not hit every button on the right side. Its not a good choice for people with small hands. i have tiny hands n it is taking me forever to write this paragraph...i keep hitting p and o...and the send button. which has caused several personal issues.
1278,5,"I would definitely recommend this product, so far, easy to use. I find different things every day."
1279,1,"Most people who require a rugged phone require physical buttons and a durable screen. Please slim this phone down a bit and bring the buttons back! This was definitely a step in the wrong direction for the Active phones, this being the 3rd i've owned."
1280,4,"I had the Samsung 7 Edge for about two years before having to downgrade. I loved the design of the phone, the back camera was amazing, it took decent Snapchat pics (they looked good on other phones. Yes, even Apple products), the speakers were loud, and I didn't have too many glitches. Cons: it ran slow at times--sometimes major lag, the front camera isn't all that, and it's a bit pricy Pros: again, the back camera is A1, the screen quality & colors are amazing (you can adjust these in the settings), you can customize the speakers (rock, pop, etc.), and the design is pretty cool. The only other thing is that I wouldn't get it with sprint (but that's neither here nor there)"
1281,1,"Well, I decided to switch over to Samsung a couple months ago because everyone talks about how great they are. So I had it for a little while took care of it, didn't beat it up and then I was setting it on my counter when it slipped out of my hand and fell 2 inches on to the counter top, completely shattering the screen. When I talked to Samsung they basically said too bad, and when I talked to repair places it was $370 to get a new screen. This wouldn't particularly bother me if they didn't tell you that the screen was made of ""Gorilla Glass"" and is ""Virtually Indestructible"". Its a waste of money and I'm going back to iPhone."
1282,3,Camera lens cracked even in a case. Not happy and then ATT want a 250.00 insurance to replace it. Only had it for 3 months. Very disappointed. I use my Camera everyday for work.
1283,4,I really enjoy having a phone that doesn't require a cheap case. Cases take away the looks of any phone. I only wish I could remove the clock from the Lock Screen.
1284,3,The strait talk version won't update to lolipop. I've tried samsung smart switch and it still won't update past kit kat. I paid a lot of money for this phone to never get an updated os.
1285,2,"I am sorry I bought this phone. After having a Note 3 this is junk. The only good things about this phone is that is charges fast and has a nice camera. Its a pain to use. The keyboard is small and not very sensitive, so it misses words. I wasn't able to transfer all my info to this phone. It is slow loading. It gets hot really easy. Weird screens open without touching it, sometimes the page gets big on its own, most of the time when I unlock it the phone will go to the call screen instead of the home screen even if the last thing I looked at was a website or an app. It's just annoying. I really regret switching. If I wasn't having problems with my text app on the note 3 that has worked great for nearly 3 years I wouldn't have switched. Live an learn. But I just don't like this phone."
1286,1,"To I am writing tell you that nobody ever thought of people that work as a mechanic, farmer, construction of any kind when they designed this phone. I love the processor and the performance of this phone. On the other hand I have broken this phone screen 2 times in one month of getting it because there is not a case out there that protects the edges like any of the last ones and there is not a screen cover that will stay attached to the curved screen as I am a mechanic and heavy equipment operator and need a screen protector. I don't care about the side features and how big the dang screen is. Actually it is to big now and will not fit into my breast pocket anymore and it to big to operate with one hand. I have never used the bigsby and the options that come off the side edge. As a result, in the future I hope they bring back a regular screened phone and think of someone else other than a business person in a suit."
1287,1,it drops calls every couple of minutes in my 17 crv. Ridiculous. going to try and return.
1288,2,"I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, I got this phone the day it came out in stores. I'm not kidding you when I say 4/5 days after having the phone, it started to freeze up and I had to manually re-boot the phone because holding down the power button for 20 minutes OBVIOUSLY wasn't working. It STILL freezes OFTEN till this day. About a month after having the phone, the charger that came with the phone inside the box, I started recieving an ""error message"" saying that my phone doesn't support that charger and wouldn't charge. This has happened with every charger I have bought after that. (I do NOT buy gas station/cheap chargers because I KNOW they can fry your phone or damage the port) and my speaker is starting to. I have had the phone now for just under 6 months.. and these problems have only gotten worse. I spoke with a Samsung rep for the first time ever, and at this point I was on the phone with my carrier and then them for nearly 2 1/2 hours, for the lady to literally act like she could not hear me and hung up the phone(I did not recieve a call back like I know normally happens if the call is dosconnected/dropped). The only plus side about this phone is the AMAZING camera quality which is WHY I upgraded from my iPhone 7 to this(biggest mistake I ever made.) I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. The other person who is on my account and got the same exact phone just in black, was experiencing the SAME issues. I will never waste my money on such a thing ever again. This was the WORST experience I have had, by far."
1289,4,"I was so excited when I ordered the S6, even pre-owned. But disappointed after having it 3 weeks. The battery won't keep a charge longer than 3 hours (even with battery saving features), I have trouble getting signal if there isn't wi-fi available and all the useless apps that I can't delete!!!"
1290,2,"Let me start by saying in 10 years of smartphones, I have never broken one. Not a single cracked screen or damaged display and this is my 4th Samsung phone after loving the others. The first thing I do is put a new phone in a protective case but made no difference here. Because of the raised nature of the Edge display, impossible to fully protect it. I placed mine (with protective case) inside pocket of my Wife's purse at dinner, and when we finished and I took it out in the car, the entire front glass was shattered. The phone wasn't dropped, the purse wasn't dropped, yet it shattered."
1291,3,"I love all the Galaxys active is a must for me but the rugby pro was my fav. Phone ever this is my 5'third s5 active no problems with the first 4 one even flew out of my pocket doing 90mph on the freeway while riding my motorcycle took me 3 days to find all the parts & when I did jus put the phone back together & it came right back on no problems jus needed new tempered glass screen protector I jus got a new one & the screen rotation has never worked very frustrating especially since I had to do a master reset & still doesn't work & I can't seem to get any help on how to fix this problem so basically jus out the money I spent on this phone & really sux right now because I jus lost ""EVERYTHING"" in the hurricane so I can't afford to buy a new one right now not sure if I see myself buying another one after this I feel like Samsung stuck me with a cap phone & wont one up to their mistake & replace this one or jus fix it that really all I want is what I payed for"
1292,1,design is useless with ordinary covers. Edges prevents screen from having protection without high priced bulky otterbox cover. Not worth the purchase of either. Terrible buy. Extremely unsatisfied.
1293,4,This phone is awsome it has dope screen loud speaker very fast and reliable
1294,5,"This such a awesome phone once again that they have design I have been a loyal customer of there for many years, and have own all of there galaxy collection and phone, and each one has always meet my expectation in performance and everything and I truly must say they out did there self with this particular phone the sound of the speaker are nice and loud, the camera is just awesome also just really love this phone all around the price was very good for me also because of the trade in of my Samsung Galaxy S7Edge and love the unlock version."
1295,5,"Really great phone, i had an iPhone 6 and this phone is so much better in my eyes. the sad thing is i dropped it in my parking lot and managed to run over it, it was very well made because it worked for 5 days and i just started to get problems. in the few days i had the fully functioning phone i loved it"
1296,5,I've had the phone for 2 years now and I'm still in awe! This device does not fail to impress!
1297,5,"Love it. Never lets me down. Battery life good, lots of useful features that actually work the way they are supposed to."
1298,5,but it does seam the possessor heats up just a little but I love the phone
1299,3,Let me start by saying I love how the phone performs and looks. I've had 2 devices SHATTER way to easily. Dropped 1 from a dining table on CARPETING with a case and ZAGG screen protector. Other was shattered by putting a case from Amazon on the device. Case lifted corner of screen and rendered device useless. Wound not buy this phone again due to how fragile it is and how much it costs.
1300,5,This phone is so reliable. I've had it for about 3 months and no complaints so far. The camera is fast and takes great shots.
1301,5,i love this phone battery life is the best out there fast charging
1302,5,"Has the latest features, bezel-less design, super fast, good battery and sound, and the best display you can get. Best phone ive event used"
1303,2,I hate I gave up my Note 4 to go to the Note 7 (twice) and now I am stuck with a phone I really hate.
1304,5,"So far this is the best phones I've seen ANDROIDS OR iPHONES. All the best style, features and performance packed into a very light and sturdy form. Extremely satisfied with the battery life and the performance of the apps. Virtual home & back buttons could be a bit tricky to use."
1305,4,I loved the organization of the features and the fact it has a place for an external SD memory card. I love the red color. I wish it came on the newer models and the NOTE series which I love. I also like the fact you can carry a spare battery and change it out when needed.
1306,5,One of the best quality picture phone I ever Handel on my live.
1307,4,I rated some pretty low stars mainly because of the NO SD CARD slot. If it had an SD card slot I would have given it 5 stars accross the board. I would recommend to a friend that doesn't put tons of apps or use their phone to play music. Other than that it's great for the price comparing to the newst S models
1308,5,is reliable. unlike my I phone . love the app store. ease of options
1309,5,"This phone is just wonderful. All the tech on it is complex but the phone itself is easy to use and easy to get around with. Camera, fabulous. Screen, satisfying. Samsung, amazing."
1310,5,"Maybe my standards are low, but this is by far one of my favorites phones, slick and quick, great with pictures. only hard part was trying to find cases that will consider the rounded edge and not warp or mess up the screen protector. Probably didnt need a screen protector, but old habits."
1311,5,"I once had a Samsung phone before this guy called the Samsung Transform. That thing was OK but ever-so... Problematic. Cheap speaker port, bad audio quality, bad quality for gaming, just ""use me for text messages and nothing else"" type of phone. So I was hesitant to get the S4-Mini when I was due for an upgrade a few years ago. Yet here I am, with my phone that's over 4 years old, and it's doing just fine. It's durable as all heck and the poor thing fell one too many times... Without a cracked screen to show for it (oh how tragic boohoo). It's just powerful enough to run games like Fire Emblem Heroes or display Youtube/Facebook. It can have these things saved in the background ready for use too. The battery life is fair, given all the stuff this little guy can handle, and it doesn't have overheating problems (but can get sizzly if you work it too hard for too long). The size feels just right. I can leave it in my pocket as a bluetooth speaker picks up what music is playing for up to 30 feet (I think more than that too). I honestly don't know how Samsung makes money if they make these things so durable and practically future proof. I'm sure there are more powerful phones, but if I wanted a phone that could do a million things... Well... Um... I'm pretty sure that's what I'd use my Desktop for. I use my phone for searching the Internet, playing/getting music, playing mobile games, and checking Social Media. I don't need it to do my taxes, find my soul mate, and play The Fast And The Furious 24 simultaneously. lol Given it's age it doesn't exactly feature the Performance or Features of a newer phone, so sadly I can only give this sweet baby a 4/5 for those categories."
1312,5,"I have invested in your product since the Galaxy S3, the Galaxy S8+ has beat out your best phone to date and that was the Galaxy S5. The only thing I do not care for is Bixby, but hey I can get use to her. Thank You, Shell44"
1313,5,This smartphone is the best money can buy. It adapts to your every need. This smartphone has replaced my wallet. Great battery life. Amazing speed. Great camera. Love the waterproof feature. Love Fast Charging and Fast Wireless Charging. Overall an amazing phone.
1314,4,So I was one of several Note 7 customers who had to begrudgingly return my beautiful device and downgrade to the S7 Edge. Adjusting to the smaller screen was a task at first but I will admit in the end still a decent device especially since I was already use to the ECO-System that is Samsung and Android. But I am happy to say I will be returning to the Note family and pray that we don't have issues of last year.
1315,1,"I was excited when they announced the phone was coming in. When received, I noted how small it was in comparison to my Note4 and was highly disappointed with that and the fact the screen was beveled and an additional screen protector had to be purchased along with the otterbox. This phone is extremely small and inconvenient and I am so unhappy with it. I'd rather had stuck with my Note4. I have gone through 5 of the screens since purchasing the phone in April 2017 with a couple being shattered during transit. I can't express enough how much I dislike this phone and the thinking the Note 8 would be bigger, it's not. Same size as S8+. I'd like to see Samsung revert back to the previous Notes with the bigger phones, much wider screens, non-beveled screens, just smooth and basic but with all the perks of new devices. I'm so looking for someone to sale this phone to and take the loss or either downgrade back to the earlier Note Models. So unhappy and will be looking for either another brand with larger phone features and comparable apps."
1316,5,"The quality of phone have been improved, I upgraded from S4 to S7 edge. The design of phone is beautiful, I have gold color it looks very rich and glass behind makes it very impressive as well. Battery lasts for 2 days without heavy usage emails, internet browsing and some games. Night time camera works great comparing other phones that came out the same year. Only small concern after using VR the home button have been scratched from it and it looks little bit obvious, however fingerprint still works."
1317,4,"I would say I'm an expert when it comes to Samsung products I own tons. I have two phones the note 8 and the S8+. The S8+ is a great phone my only issue is the Wi-Fi connection drops frequently. I have changed my internet modem and router [thinking that was the issue] I even exchanged my phone for a new one, and I still have the same issue with the Wi-Fi connectivity. I know it's the phone because my relative has the same problem at her home. With my other device, the Note 8 I don't have that issue AT ALL. Samsung really needs to correct this, these phones are too expensive to have Glitches."
1318,2,"I switched from an Iphone 5S to Samsung Galaxy S8 a couple months ago and I am very disappointed with the performance this equipment. The battery doesn't last more than a full day under normal using conditions and if I want the battery to last for a whole day, I have to switch the set up to mid power saving mode, sacrificing performance over battery life. I am surprised by just how hot the phone gets when I use it. I've had many phones but this is the first one to get uncomfortably hot in my hand or against my ear. When I put it in my pocket I can feel the heat on my leg. Bixby requires a lot of work! This assistant is a hit and miss. In some occasions it activates on its own while I am in the middle of a meeting or while I am driving. Yes, while I am driving, sometimes Bixby hears the activation command from the radio and starts to take notes. It is really funny to see Bixby trying to catch up with the speakers. Besides the two mentioned issues, I like the design and the apps. I like switching from OS to Android but I think I paid too much for this brand. Looking forward to finishing my two years contract to move to another brand."
1319,5,"Switched from being a long time iPhone user to never wanting to go back. Everything about this phone from it's design to it's function has exceeded my expectations. Fantastic battery life, gorgeous screen, and quick performance, just to name a few of the great things that stand out about this phone."
1320,5,Upgraded from the S7 way faster and more responsive. Still getting used to no physical Home button. Other wise very impressed!
1321,5,"Ok, I love everything about my phone but isn't the Coral Blue supposed to look more like sky blue then a darker metallic dark blue. The website should fix their photos plus all the YouTube video I've seen on color still look way lighter than mine. Was there any other blue sold that could have been placed in my box by accident? Built in China, Box says Coral blue but way darker than expected."
1322,2,"I felt really Awe when i saw the device but .. it created problems like My Samsung Pay was not working some times and then my charging was switching itself from Fast to Normal, and I'm facing lot's of call Drops..!!! what 's going on....?"
1323,5,This phone has served me well as a hold over for the Note 8!!
1324,5,I switched from an iPhone 6s to a Samsung galaxy s8 and I'm not going to lie it did take me a bit of time to get used to the galaxy but now it's been a couple of days and I love it. It feels really comfortable in your hand and the curved screen makes the picture a lot bigger even though the phone isn't too big. Also the camera is amazing! Would recommend.
1325,5,"I've owned the 2, 5 and now the 8. So far this is the best of the Android phones I've seen. All the best features and performance packed into a very light and sturdy form. Extremely satisfied with the battery life and the performance of the apps."
1326,5,"Best Phone I've had, so far. I have fun playing games and using the apps that I have had"
1327,5,"Does everything that I need it to do, personal and business. Never slowed down with tons of files on it. Very dependable and reliable device. Also withstood a few drops. Samsung devices are superior to all others."
1328,1,"I got this phone for a month now. I always take so much care of my phones, I don't take it out without a case and a film. Today I had it in my pocket and once I take it out, completely out of the blue, the screen is shattered close to the earphone. I only could've hit it with my hand. This is the most fragile phone I have ever had and seen. I contacted Samsung ask how could this happened with a supposedly indestructible screen. They would only say that it cannot scratch but can break, no answers, bad phone, and of course they don't care about it. Never buying from Samsung again."
1329,1,"Bixby is terrible. I can't even use my phone. Bixby will come up randomly, even when it's only sitting on the table. I turned voice activation off, I turned the page to the left of home off, and the page still comes up. I hate this phone, I hate Bixby, and I hate Samsung. Now I'm stuck with a phone I hate for 2 years. I'd almost rather not have a phone at all."
1330,1,Phone battery backup is horrible. Charges slowly with the adapter and cable provided by Samsung. The phone is very slow when compared to my iPhone 7. Speakers are very bad. Very disappointing and regretting as I switched from iPhone to Samsung.
1331,2,"I'm very disappointed in Samsung's S8. I have been a faithful user of Samsung phones for 5 years now, and have never even scratched a screen on any of them. However, I've had this S8 since only April 2017, and the screen has broken in two places. I must say that I truly expected better from this phone."
1332,5,"had this phone for years, updates this last month suck. have insurance with Verizon a deal that will never be offered again. Thinking no more updates, phone quits working Verizon has no choice but to replace. Tired of every other day update lose contacts and messages. Was a great phone till updates."
1333,5,"This phone is amazing. The camera is great and so is the display. I rarely take my DSLR, and use my S8+ to take all my pictures and videos."
1334,5,"Excellent phone, video and camera. This is exactly what I wanted as my personal phone. great storage and easy to program as I wish."
1335,5,"works well, this is my second samsaung g 6. good camera too"
1336,2,"i have had this phone since July 22, 2017 and have had it back to the store twice for the same issue. the phone frozen on the home screen for no apparent reason, when i took it to verizon they could find no issue with the phone. it has not been dropped, wet, or damaged in any way. each time it had only been for 10 minutes max. today sept 9, the phone has been frozen on the home sceen since 6:21 pm and it is now 8:24 pm. i reached out to samsung support because verizon has no offices open today due to the hurricane and i can't call, restart or turn off the phone to get help! i have many samsung products, but this phone has been the worse experience for me EVER!"
1337,5,"By far, the best phone I have ever owned. I have had it since it came out 5 or 6 months ago. No problem at all. Bixby is cool, but I honestly wish it wasn't a button. It would do well just as a pre-loaded app. The camera is amazing in so many different settings. Everything from PRO to night time taking, etc. I have gone through water, the pool, rain, etc. and not any damage. It truly is a water resistant phone, of course up specifications^^ But every app and button responds rapidly. Fastest processor and able to customize this phone more than any other Galaxy I have owned. More options such as app button, widgets, settings, device maintenance optimizing. Overall, I recommend. Everyone needs it, especially over Apple phones that don't compare to all these features!! ( :"
1338,5,ITS THE MOST AMAZING PHONE FOR 2017 EVEN 2018. Go and buy it even the note 8
1339,5,"I absolutely love this phone, I must say Samsung out do themselves with every update."
1340,5,"This is my backup secondary device, incredible smart phone water, dust and life proof......The galaxy S6 active is small in size voluminous in features and performance again your product is engineered to perfection and will stand the test of man and time."
1341,5,I love my Samsung S8 phone! It has a lot of great features. Glad I was able to get 1.
1342,5,This product has great camera and battery time. Great features
1343,5,"I was really debating whether to buy this phone, get a Pixel or the latest I-phone. However, this phone is AMAZING! The camera is indeed Amazing! The processor runs insanely smooth (I don't have millions of apps). Probably my favorite feature is the ""Performance Mode"". It definitely helps our for the Task at hand! The video quality is just AMAZING! The speaker in the bottom right of the phone isn't that amazing, but it still gives quality sound! If you do get this phone, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT! Get the 128GB or 256GB! TOTALLY worth having that much space if needed! I don't use BIXBY, but hopefully they make her justice in the future. Thank You Samsung! Hopefully this phone last me at least 3 years til your new phone comes out or I'm able to afford one!"
1344,4,"Disclosure - I never wanted this phone, but you know... Note 7, and then another Note 7. Samsung said they'd discount my Note 8 if I got this phone, so here we are. Good phone. I definitely didn't think I'd like the rounded edges, but it's pretty cool. This phone is decently powerful, and the camera is good. All of which outperformed the Note 3 I had been using before, but not as amazing as the Note 7. Waterproof? You bet! I take it underwater with me while shooting photos and video. The only thing I'd change if I could: turn screen sensitivity off while underwater somehow, using the volume buttons to start and stop video, take photos, and whatever else. Video starts and stops when holding the camera underwater since it thinks I'm touching it everywhere. Price was a bit high for just being a basic phone."
1345,5,"The S8 fits perfectly in my hands, it may be a little to long but it still fits perfect. I've never owned a top of the brand phone, and this has to be the best smartphone I've ever layed my hands on. I thank Best Buy for their deals, I got this phone Open Box Excellent from their website. It types so smooth, the display is beautiful! It's a very slick phone! You guys are so awesome at what you do!"
1346,5,I had always wanted a Galaxy edge phone and buying s7 edge was a very good decision. I like it very much.
1347,5,"I am very rough on everything, and this S6 Active has handled being dropped , kicked, scraped, rained on, sat on, left in the car in the blazing heat. Ill never buy another phone that isn't an Active from Samsung and AT&T"
1348,1,"Barely dropped my S8 within a week of having it and the screen shattered. I had an iPhone for 2 years with no breaks and dropped it much further and harder. Would not recommend buying this phone and if so, get insurance! If others are having this issue as well I wish Samsung would stand by their product or admit that it breaks easily."
1349,3,The features are nice. The camera is very clear and works great. The design is terrible. So far they have not created a case that covers the entire phone to protect it. I had to buy a case for the back and a tempered glass cover for the front. They do not meet up on the sides. My phone cracked in the gap (space between the tempered glass and case) in my pocket a week after purchase. I spend extra money on the cases to protect the phones and this is the first phone I have ever damaged.
1350,5,"This phone is better than any other I've used ,When I was younger my dream phone was going to be an iPhone but when I saw the Samsung phones is back in 2014 I realized that displays were much Bigger and better and I realized they were much more features and they were all better and I thought I rather go with the samsungs because of the features and a large display ! In my 1st phone I had with the Galaxy core prime but then when that phone became insufficient for me in April 2017 I decided to upgrade to the GS8 because there would be so much more features like the Iris scanner Samsung pass Samsung pay Heart rate monitor Edge swipe Fancy customization theme engine !!! You name it !! It is definitely a great upgrade no matter how old your current phone is !! You should definitely look forward to the upcoming note 8 !!The amazing edge display makes all other phones look so outdated already !"
1351,5,"I really like this phone. It has a great display, a really nice camera (some of the extras like selective focus are great to use) and it a nice size compared to some of the monster's out there."
1352,2,I have only had this phone for nine months and it does not hold a charge for more than four hours and it also gets very hot at times in my pocket.
1353,4,"I am loving this phone! I am your typical IPhone user, and honestly I thought I would never be caught with using this device. But, I decided to make a big change, and try something different. I got my s8+ on Friday Sept 1st and was very nervous about the purchase. I did have some issues with transferring my information from my IPhone with smart switch, but I eventually got it to work. I've been using it heavily for the past few days, and I have no complaints. The battery life is FREAKING AMAZING! It takes no time to charge my phone. And when I have a full battery, it does not die fast! As I stated I am a heavy user, and I am on social media 247. All applications are fast, and responsive. I do have one issue though.... the front facing camera... I don't know if it is just based of me being use to my IPhone, or something of that nature but I honestly don't like it. I looks really odd. Don't get me wrong though, the back camera is FREAKING AWESOME, but the front one is just... eh. It looks low quality. I would recommend otherwise!"
1354,1,The screen will crack very easy even with a durable case! Do not buy you will regret!
1355,5,"really enjoying this phone, still learning about all the features that it has, in my opinion, this is just about the perfect phone out there, worth getting."
1356,2,"I have had this phone less than 3 months, and already it has fallen apart. The screen cracked, and the charger won't work. My last galaxy was great, and durable. Very disappointed in this phone."
1357,1,I would not recommend this phone I will never buy one of these again
1358,5,"I upgraded from the S7 Active. The new Active 8 is unbelievable, I can go 2 days without charging my phone (normal use). I've already have dropped this multiple times and not a scratch on it. Color and screen is the best on the market. I did notice they got rid of the aqua view in the camera settings. Also wish they would of upgraded the camera, but again its still the best camera on the market. I did just purchase a screen protector for it the other day. The speaker is better. Overall I am happy with this phone."
1359,5,"There's so much to love about this phone, from it's amazing camera that takes the best pics ever, even at night right on down to it's hands down speed. Having a host of Samsung's products this Galaxy S7 Edge is by far my favorite. The fastest download and upload speeds I've ever seen in a single device. I bought this phone aka handheld computer to retire my Galaxy S4 and as a upgrade after looking through tons of reviews and most important, seeking out the specs. Missing a few features that I love about my S4 such as the infrared blaster and being able to add signature in messages as well as my snow white color like my S4 or pearl white like my Galaxy Tab 3 tablet. This phone is super sleek just as I like it. Not only is this device feature packed, it is also feature rich as well. Even in the Otter Box Defender series case it's sleek and beautiful."
1360,5,I have tried almost all phones on the market and have just switched over to this device. The biggest feature is that screen. The screen is incredible. The design is great. Feels great in the hand too.
1361,5,The screen is so much bigger than the g6 edge I traded in for.
1362,4,"I've had the Galaxy S8 for three months and it really is gorgeous. I also love the customization options and the secure folder feature. I just really wish the screen wasn't so fragile. In three years (years!) my iphone screen never had a scratch and I was not by any means careful with that poor thing. It's a miracle it never shattered. With this phone I feel like it'll be a miracle if I only have to replace the screen once. Maybe I'm being picky, but I feel that the beautiful design is severely undermined by its fragility."
1363,3,It's an outstanding phone and view the quilt I have experienced and want them to see what Samsung has to offer. Great product Samsung keep up with the outstanding products you have coming out
1364,5,"I love this phone! It's perfect for me in every way. The photos it takes are stunning! The size is perfect. The infinity screen is beautiful. I never use the Bixby function, but it is nice to have. I love that it's water resistant. The battery life is the biggest surprise for me because I don't have to charge my phone twice a day anymore, and when I do charge it, it charges so fast. My only cons are the fingerprint detector is in an awkward spot. I have tiny hands and fingers, and even with my popsocket on my phone, I have to stretch my finger to reach the sensor. The other con is the speaker isn't as loud as I'd like it to be. Other than those 2 things, I am absolutely crazy for this dang phone."
1365,5,This is a great phone. It does not drain my battery even when I have multiple apps installed. It's easy to use.
1366,4,"The phone runs great. It's very fast. But, just like my 2 Note 7's and S7, the screen cracks VERY EASY. My S8+ screen has a crack and a spider web within the 1st 12 hours."
1367,5,"I love this phone!! Just when you wonder how Samsung could possibly upgrade the S7, then comes along the S8!! The only problem I have is Bixby. But maybe I need to explore it more."
1368,3,"Don't get me wrong, I love my phone. There are points in time where I have no problems with it what so ever. However, there are far too many times that I have to suffer from the functional errors of the device. To start with, I only got this device again because it was cheaper than buying another phone when the one I originally had, decided not to turn on again. What makes that even better, is the fact that all of my supposedly backed up files, were no where to be found. I lost all of my information that is very crucial to my everyday life. No one would even offer to look at my phone to see if there was any hope for fixing it and restoring all of my lost data. Anyways, before my phone shut off for good, the battery would drain quickly, everything would freeze up, it would shut on and off in the middle of what I was doing. I'm certainly not the only one who uses their phone for work and when I'm in the middle of something important, it'd be nice to be able to finish it without disruptions. I understand things like this happen occasionally but this was a multiple times a day type thing! Not very pleased."
1369,5,"It's really a great phone in regards to functrions, APPS, style, looks and feel. There is only one advice that I would recommend to those who are interested in this phone. You should first make sure you read and understand all features and functionalities on the subject for locking and unlocking your cell phone. Especially if your memory isn't up to speed as it use to be. Second, you immediately setup your Sumsung account information and setup remote access on your phone so you can remotely control your phone from a PC."
1370,4,This could have been a great phone but the location of the fingerprint scanner is terribly awkward. I could not get used to it and had to return it on the 14th day. The poor battery life also was unfortunate. It performed smoothly and was fast. It also has a lot of useful features not found on a lot of other phones.
1371,2,"It took me 4 days to scratch the screen on this thing. I traded in a 2 year old S5 with pristine glass. I think the curvature just exposes it and makes it easy to scratch. It's very hard to find a case with a built in screen protector for it, and I hate stick on protectors. The curved glass has no utility; I guess it's supposed to be pretty. If you value form over function, it's your money, I guess. I'd rather have a package that isn't as flimsy as a raw egg. I have no complaints about how it works."
1372,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is an amazing phone. There is no lag in using the phone, the battery life is great and the camera performs well. I have no issues with sound or apps or random restarts or shutdowns."
1373,5,"This phone has a beautiful look. Outstanding camera and amazing features. Lots of space as well for pics,cames,videos and more."
1374,5,"I bought this phone because it had the gyroscope feature on it. I never realized what all it truly has. It can even act like a remote! Woah. And the quality of pictures using the rear camera is amazing. I love this phone and I'll probably never buy a different galaxy until one that has the exact same features (or more) come out. However, it could just be my phone in particular, but the bluetooth and the phone jack (for headphones) mess up the music quality every now and again. As in it goes super fuzzy at random times in the middle of a song. And it won't even play certain songs either, it just completely skips over them."
1375,5,"Excellent design, display, and performance. Kudos to Samsung.."
1376,3,"I've been trying this voice bixby app to work since I bought it, first it was it needed an update, then it was released and since it was, been trying to make this work. NO matter what do I do, it doesnt work, keeps telling me that I need to update the software and when I do, bummmmm, it says the software is up to date, so no Bixby. Otherwise, think I would like better my old S7+"
1377,3,Unlocked S8 device does not support HD video call.
1378,5,This was the best phone I ever owned. I could say a lot thing but I just do not have to. Right?!!! Can Imjust say that I love my phone.?!
1379,5,"Upgraded from the Samsung S5 to the S8. WOW what a phone! Brilliant Color, tons of storage. This phone will do more than I will ever use it for with all the built in features! Bixby is really cool. Fingerprint scanner being located on the back will take some time getting used too but other than that I have no cons about this cell phone. Camera takes beautiful HD pics and vids! Only had it for about a week so far and love it! My S5 worked so well I hated giving it up but the upgrade to S8 was well worth it it more ways than 1."
1380,5,"This phone is amazing, I really enjoy how futuristic it looks and it's feel in my hand the reason I gave 4 years on the design is nothing against the design itself it's just the minor problems I have with the edged display, web pages cut off, I sometimes accidentally skip forward in YouTube videos what would fix this is probably a dead zone where the main part of the display is to make it easier for multimedia"
1381,4,Best phone on the market and is years ahead of its time. Crushes the iPhone 7. Just watch out for defective ones. Seems many people have gotten defective Galaxy s8 and s8+. Samsung should test them better before selling them.
1382,5,"Have been using this s8 for a month, It's been great. The features and design are great, just that the screen gets a little greasy (probably my fault.)"
1383,1,Just purchased this phone 19 days ago and already have to have it replaced. The top 1/2 inch of the display is no longer responsive and will not work. Cannot access the notification bar or anything. I am 5 days out of the return window so I had to process a warranty claim with AT&T. The best part is I get to get a USED phone that someone else didn't want and I still get to pay $850 for it! Yay me!
1384,4,"Pro-I really like the Galaxy S8+. Due to poor eye sight, I like the edge to edge screening so I can use the larger font. Love the Samsung DEX, I can view the phone on my computer screening for better viewing when in my home office. Thumps-up on the design and DEX. Con-Thumps down – (Speaker Phone) I take conference calls on my way to work and when I’m on the speaker my callers cannot hear me clearly. I use hands free calling and if I need to respond to a question while listening to a conference call, the caller can’t not hear me clearly. The built-in speaker is poor while In the office, home office or auto."
1385,2,"I have been a Samsung Galaxy loyalist since the S III. I owned the S III, S5, S7, and now S8. I was really excited when I got the S8 but I am returning it to Verizon under the 15-day return rule for a new S7. The taller screen on the S8 gives amazing space and the display is gorgeous . I didn't get around to doing much with Bixby. Beyond that, I see few differences to the S7 but that's not why I'm returning it. I'm returning because of 2 glaring deficiencies that make it intolerable to keep. 1.) BATTERY - it takes forever to charge compared to my S7 (using brand new cord provided with the phone) and the battery drains much faster than my prior S7. It says it is fast charging but always underestimates the amount of time to fully charge, which is about 3 hours. I thought I had a defective phone but an internet search reveals the unfortunate fact that many are complaining about this and I am too dependent on my cell to await a software fix (if that's even possible and forthcoming as some have suggested). 2.) TOUCH SCREEN - with a tempered glass front cover on, you have to touch REALLY hard to get the screen to respond . It sometimes takes me 3 to 4 attempts of PUNCHING a button hard to make it respond; ditto for sliding the screen, particularly top to bottom. Again, an internet search found countless others expressing this same problem. Users who took the screen cover off don't have this problem but given that I have cracked the glass cover on prior phones more than once (and assumedly saved my glass phone in the process), I am not willing to take it off and risk breaking my very expensive phone. Tech user responses to this problem are that due to the curved edges of the phone, the tempered glass can't sit as well and is the cause of the problem. Two less important annoyances are that the power button is much harder to press than the S7 and I HATE the time which appears on two lines on the ""always on screen"" and there are no built-in alternatives. There are however some apps with different option in the Google Play Store. Finally, I have to say it again - can we just stick to a standard charging type. When you have two or more people in the same house/car, having different chargers for each one is SUCH a pain. Well, I have loved every odd numbered Samsung so hopefully the S9 will again be all that I have come to expect from a Samsung phone."
1386,5,"This phone is cool. It is fast, streamlined, and much less bloaty than past samsung phones. Best phone i ever had and i have had quite a few. No doubt in my mind that you will be happy with the purchase."
1387,1,I sat down and the phone is so slippery that it slided out my pocket and landed on the floor and the screen easily cracked in less than two feet.... Gorilla Glass 5 is no good... the phone was only two weeks old.......
1388,4,"The Samsung Galaxy s8 is the best phone out there this year. It has a great build and an over all great value for the software, definitely a great value for the money"
1389,5,The phone is beautiful and very durable I'm happy with the build quality. The screen is amazing and bright and very clear.
1390,5,"I love my new S8+ there are a few features that were removed, but I can leave without them."
1391,5,Loved the S5 Active when I had it. Performance was great and I loved the face that I didn't have to have a bulky phone cover with it. Also loved having actual buttons at the bottom of the screen instead of the touch buttons.
1392,5,"I love my Galaxy S8. I loved my S6 edge+ before it. I now own a Samsung TV, Watch, Tablet, everyone in the family has Samsung phones, Laptop and stove. WE are a 100% Samsung Family. The phone meets all my needs. I have a iPhone that was issued by my employer, I would still rather have my Galaxy! My daughter used it to take pictures and videos in the pool underwater. LOVE THIS PHONE!"
1393,5,I have had the S7E for almost a year now and I am still impressed by it's performance and features. The edge apps add that extra layer of usability. The camera and battery life are excellent!
1394,1,My phone has an Otterbox and a screen protector on it my dog jumped up on a chair that is about a foot off the ground and the phone fell and the screen is cracked I've only had this phone 2 weeks or less the voice recognition sucks in Bixby is a joke
1395,4,"though there are new models of samsung to choose from, i am still happy with the s6 edge after about 3 years."
1396,4,"I honestly love the speed and ease of use with the Samsung S7. The display is clear, the pictures are great and my grandson loves taking it exploring around the house. I love the split screen abilities, its much easier to navigate with both screens available. I have to say, I loved the original edge phones in the note 7. It was easier to set up, use and not accidentally hit the edge screen while in a call or picking up the phone. The all glass enclosure has been a huge set back for me. I have used Samsung phones since they entered the smart phone line up. I usually keep a phone for at least 4-5 years as they just never died, and never had a problem with cracking screens etc, and actually enjoyed having a giggle at some with other phones that broke in their pocket. Unfortunately , I now find myself being at the end of the giggles. On a more personal note, I miss the wider display as well. Its a personal choice of my own, as the display is clear enough to read, I just prefer the wider screen area over the length continuing to get longer."
1397,5,I am quite impressed with the phone. I refused to use Samsung since the S3 but this phone exceeded my expectations.
1398,4,This is an amazing device other than Bixby. Bixby works when you don't want it to work and when you want it work well that's to bad. In order to actually use the phone I had to go into the settings and kill Bixby. The Bixby button would be better of being a Google assistant button. That way it would actually work.
1399,1,"Great phone, but do not buy unlocked if you hope to have Samsung protection. after buying the unlocked version and trying to purchase premium care i was informed that the unlocked version is not eligible for the service. Only carrier versions are. Customer service has dodged all my questions about the issue and refused"
1400,2,"This may help others who are considering the Unlocked S8. Note: As of today, no options available from either AT&T or Samsung to enable WiFi calling. After multiple trips to AT&T, BestBuy Samsung, chat sessions with Samsung support and now calling Samsung Premium Care, I finally confirmed that the Unlocked S8 model does not have any possible software upgrade to enable WiFi calling. Why did so many not know? I wasted extra money on replacing/activating another SIM card, protective case and installing a glass screen protector not knowing that it was not capable of WiFi calling. Samsung: Please revise your website to clearly state the limitation, (WiFi calling is not possible on AT&T network ), with the Unlocked version of your S8 phones. What's Next? I was told that there is nothing that Samsung can do for me but Return the phone for Refund. Now returning this phone requires me to again pay the additional cost for replacing/activating another SIM for my old phone to use during the time I process an order for my next phone. Samsung cost me hours of my time and wasted my money. Summary: This is my Samsung WiFi experience on the unlocked version of the S8. I did like the phone and wanted to keep it. WiFi calling is important as the wireless signal is often problematic in my area. The easiest part of my journey... returning is easy via the Samsung website."
1401,2,"I've only owned this phone for 2 months. It has always been in a case and has never been dropped. The back glass is cracking near the volume buttons already. I've never had a phone crack and I'm baffled as to why this phone is so fragile. Extremely disappointed and feel that this is a manufacturer defect rather than damage. Also, I would love it if it were able to disable Bixby."
1402,2,"Bad luck or... found one dead pixel on day one, during setup process. Samsung offers me to send the unit for service to fix defective display (14 days return period expired). Now I'm HAPPY to have refurbished device for a full price. Resume: Don't trust Samsung ads as burn-in pixels issue exists on S8 (attaching screenshot). Check your device as soon as you receive it."
1403,4,"This phone has to be the best I have owned to date but..... the texting capability on this particular model is extremely frustrating! I have tried tweaking the size of the keyboard, different types of keyboards and get the same results. The predictive text or possibly the auto correct is too aggressive. I have saved my customer words etc and it still will replace them without hesitation. Back to the keyboard, I don't know if it is me or not (it's not) but I have asked 3 other s8+ owners and they all say the keyboard/texting feature went down hill. Mashing the keys you want tend to go to something you never expected to type unfortunately. Over all I give it about a 4.5 out of 5, fix the keyboard and the 5 is all yours Samsung!"
1404,5,best phone ever. Samsung out did it self this time.
1405,4,"ugh! like many, i made the mistake of taking the phone out of the box, and not directly into a case. first drop to ground, less than 24 hours owning device (unlocked), fell... cracked back screen."
1406,5,"This device is nothing short of amazing. It offers all the usual great Samsung features plus some. The accessibility features are very useful. The size is perfect for my one handed use, but has enough heft if I want to use it with two hands in landscape mode. The camera is the best out there, and the pre loaded filters are awesome. I have yet to run out of power before the end of my long 8 pm days. If by some chance one needs to top off before heading back out for a night of fun, there are options. Wireless fast charging or wired; either way, you'll be back up to at least 80% by the time you shower and dress. This phone is a workhorse that fits in the palm of your hand. And the screen is one of, if not THE best out there!"
1407,2,"Not good at all except camera quality and battery life. Expensive, not useful, permanent lags after 6 months of using. Factory reset did not help. Display cracked after falling on...carpet!!!! Edge panels interfere to print."
1408,5,This phone surpasses all phones on the market in my personal opinion. The features that this phone offers is limitless and the power this phone gives is undeniably breathtaking. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who is trying to enjoy life on a different level.
1409,2,"I received the phone yesterday on a trade in deal with Samsung. It arrived DOA. the phone continously reset itself. I wonder how many more phones are being shipped out like this? Looks like it did not pass product quality testing before it gets shipped to customers. still waiting for Samsung to email me the return label. I'm disappointed. In fairness, I'll update my review when I get my replacement and able to test the unit again."
1410,5,i must say i love this phone alot just wish it had an ir blaster but thats ok
1411,5,Great phone!!! if i could i would buy the note but they are really expensive but worth every cent.
1412,5,Best Camera Superior display Elegant design Great Battery life
1413,5,"The galaxy s8+ has a huge long lasting battery, can have a great amount of storage added to its 64GB storage, can be used as the gear be, can be turned into a computer with dex station and is very fast for a phone."
1414,5,I love this phone so much. It is like I always have my laptop available. Small but very very fierce.
1415,3,I switched from iPhone (had been iPhone user since initial launch) to the S8+ based on recommendation and office/work/excel compatibility. Loved the features and cool factor of the new S8+. Super fast and fantastic camera. After 4 months I still like the processor speed but think i will switch back to iPhone when my contract is up. I have never broken a phone screen in the past 10 or more years. Three months in with my new highly hyped S8+ I knocked my phone (with a Mophie battery phone case on it) off a coffee table at home onto a tile floor and now I have broken screen. 4 months in and the fingerprint scanner isn't working. Cool security feature but it doesn't do any good when it doesn't work. Frustrating but not s show stopper.
1416,5,I have an s7 has many awesome features and more than very capable to multitask pr anything. This phone is outstanding and affordable
1417,5,"Can't say enough about the design and the responsiveness. Samsung has truly come into its own as a world-class smartphone designer, and the S8+ shines brightly in its impressive lineup."
1418,5,"I loved my S7 Active, but this phone blows it away! The battery life is fantastic, it runs very fast, and the camera takes excellent pics! All previous versions of Samsung's Galaxy line pale in comparison. Soooo glad I upgraded to the S8 Active!"
1419,5,"This phone has the best quality camera out there !!! I like using my smartphone for my small business needs, as well as for my personal needs. This phone gives me the best features for both, business and personal uses. I tried many phones, but this phone has the best quality camera out there. I am able to take beautiful HDR photographs, even in the dark lighting. Amazing !!! Samsung has never let me down, and I remain a loyal fan !!! Not to mention to amazing Samsung Mobile device insights Program, through which I have received this great phone, in return for my feedback. It's been a pleasure being able to help with testing Samsung's features. Thank you Samsung !!! You are the best!! Much love, your most loyal customer, Anna"
1420,5,"All that has function of this phone are great except one which has a problem with earphone. I cannot listen to music , voice with Headphone. Maybe It is not work in Earphone connection of the Phone. Overall good, but has a defect in my new phone. Basic functions often are more important than gorgeous works. I think Earphone function is very important as cell phone. It seems necessary to improve the completeness of the products before it is sold to consumers."
1421,5,I'm addicted to this phone. It's features are easy to use. There was one problem I had with the phone is you can't use factory sound once you've set it to Zedge or whatever.
1422,5,"Great, great phone ,excellent recommend , buy now...."
1423,3,"I bought this phone in May 2017, So I have had it for 3 months now. The camera is great but just yesterday it stopped working without any warning. I was playing a game and charging at the same time and it just turned itself off and that was the end of it. I used all the technical support I could get on line and from my phone provider and it still won't come back on. This is a first for me. This is very unreliable and irritating."
1424,5,This is the best phone I have had so far!! The screen is amazing and the functionality is great.
1425,5,"I've had my fair share of phones, this is by far the best"
1426,5,I am not disappointed in this phone so far. Nice Value.
1427,3,"The Galaxy S5 is an amazing phone, capable of so much. However, if you buy the Verizon or AT&T models you get a crippled version. You cannot root or unlock them, they were specifically manufactured to prevent it. I don't blame Samsung, they wanted Verizon and AT&T's business and this was the only way they could make phones for them. This also applies to the MVNO carriers that use Verizon's or AT&'s network, so do your homework before buying a phone. I can't even get a newer version of android than 4.4.2, it is now August of 2017! I will never buy another phone from a carrier again, so much better to buy unlocked direct from the manufacturer. Please note my review scores refer to the watered down version of the S5 only, if I could root it I would be very happy with this phone."
1428,5,This phone is amazing!! Great performance excellent quality! The only negative is you need a case because it is extremely slick and is hard to keep a good grip on!
1429,5,I like the product. Great display and excellent battery life.
1430,5,"Overall great phone. I reviewed this item fair without considering the Note 7 recall. Yes, I did come from the both recalls. Disappointing I had to downgrade to an 8 month old phone that is not equal to the Note 7 but overall this is a great phone and will rate this for what it is. Supports up to 256gb external storage which is a big pro for this phone because not many competitors had that storage capacity. The 3,600 mAh battery gives me hours of battery life and can't be more pleased with it. The display ratio makes the display larger without making the device itself bulky. Very well put together design. IP68 water resistance is very nice to have so I don't have to worry about splashes. This phone is loaded with features making multitasking with ease. I do recommend this phone."
1431,3,"The phone is great if not for the one glaring issue. Bixby and the button that will not go away. Serious design flaw. The side of the phone which there is a good chance for incidental contact is where a dedicated button to launching Bixby is. You are not allowed to turn it off, or remap it. I went to the S8 direct from Samsung to avoid carrier bloatware, and it turns out there is this one baked in. If your software is good, users will want it. If not they should be able to UNINSTALL IT!"
1432,2,Samsung refused to fix the pink line issue because I had a crack in my screen. I never asked for the screen to be replaced but I wanted the pink line taken care of.
1433,5,This phone is absolutely the best thing Samsung has ever created. Not only is it sexy secure and user-friendly It also is waterproof And they offer insurance. BETTER THAN IPHONE 7 I promise this phone will meet the consumers expectations no matter the the critic the proof will shine that Samsung has earned respect and proved dedication to consumer demands Samsung has re rebounded from the mishaps with this Perfect Sexy Galaxy S8.
1434,5,"I love this phone. I like everything about it and the ability to secure not only my data but my applications as well? Outstanding! It is even better after I bought it from Samsung directly (unlocked) because even though I don't plan to leave my carrier, I don't have all the junk imposed by the carrier and should they give me reason, I can always take my phone and leave. It was also cheaper than the carrier specific locked phones. (still trying to figure that one out). I looked at the S8 and there just wasn't enough difference to make me want to upgrade from a phone I already know and love. I'll be buying the S7 Edge until they are no longer sold."
1435,1,I purchased new phone through Samsung website and there was broken pixel on the left side top of the phone while activation for brand new one. They sent a defective phone. very disappointed Do not get Samsung S8
1436,1,"The S8 as a phone is a disaster: the WORST keyboard options ever, bad battery life, poor wi-fi, Chrome doesn't work well, many apps dont work properly, heavy esoecially with any protective cover, touch screen sensitivity POOR, will not charge in some vehicles like Hyundai, wireless charging fails, security features bad or slow - iris and fingerprint reader fail repeatedly, passcode entry slow - sound volume on voice calls very low have to ALWAYS use speaker, Smart Switch software for transferring data from previous phone failed too many times had ro reenter data manually, blue tooth performance poor, speaker quality worse than samsung S3, phone will shut down on its own at any time, CALLER ID DISASTER no calling for 11 hours (IS THIS A PHONE?????), no more Samsung Memo & Samsung Notes Bad and can't read Memo files, phone is heavy and awkward to hold and use. HAVE TO TAP SCREEN ICONS MULTIPLE TIMES for response, BIXBY very BAD and useless, USBC no good have to carry adapter everywhere nobody sells them, same for micro sd card can't change without special pin lost the 1st week, can't use spare battery. The Good : no fire, nice camera, bright screen as long as more than 5% battery left. Use it as a camera only. Get another device for a phone."
1437,5,"alright i dont know where to start but first of all, i was an iphone fan, and when samsung release the s8 it got me thinking to buy one. When i have it, i was so amazed by the design ( i dont like where they put the finger print) the quality of the phone and the features is so amazing. It feels like i dont wanna go back to being an iphone fan boy. SAMSUNG rock!!"
1438,2,I had the device in it official Samsung case continually scratched device to the point of a simple drop in case caused it to crack
1439,5,"I really, really love my Galaxy S8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1440,4,"Overall the phone is a good phone. It has a lot of features that are entreating to people that are techs. It is very user friendly with a great display & fast processor. Let me not forget the camera It's Amazing!!! Only problem I have with my S8 is the daily updates which are a bit annoying. Also the water resistance feature. I was told by the support team that the updates have been causing the phone to display a message ""Check charging port moisture detected."""
1441,5,"I bought this phone for my wife ( I am iPhone user).. but now I am in love with this phone ... Great display , photo quality , video quality and best one is Samsung pay ... virtually accepted every where. Construction and size of phone is great. Next time when I will try to upgrade my phone I am definitely going to consider Samsung for me also :)"
1442,5,Great phone for the modern generation. Fully loaded.
1443,5,its a little heavy but the camera is freaking awesome.
1444,5,"I love it, I am using the Samsung product for first time."
1445,1,"SM-G95OU SN 06798 Purchase date 2017.06.21 The voice mail app on my phone will not show the number of message that I have in the inbox. The notification is there, but there is no indicator on the app icon. I went to a Sprint store (tech) and they could not resolve this issue. There was a new S8 in the store which proved the indicator works. Another, dislike of my S8 is the Bixby feature. I do not want to use this feature. It can be turn off, but if the button is pushed, it will come on. This is very irritating and I want it removed. Upload filesOptional"
1446,3,"Front camera poses problems while taking selfies, photos come out blurry."
1447,5,I absolutely love this phone! Everything you ever expected from a Galaxy is polished in this version. I love the fingerprint sensor on the back. Works flawlessly every time.
1448,5,"When the S8 models were released in the States I felt a bit dejected because this market was limited to black, silver, and orchid Grey colors despite knowing that other colors that were popular here were being sold over seas. I had purchased three coral blue beauty in the Note7 and S7 Edge editions and knew that buying the S8+ in any other color would leave me wanting for more, specifically in a shade of blue. There's something about Samsung's shade of blue, when applied to their stellar designed smart phones that's pure magic. At initial release I purchased an orchid grey S8+, and once the coral blue model was announced for the States I made plans to get this amazing phone in the shade I truly wanted, which I did yesterday Sunday, July 23rd. I also ordered Samsung's blue protective case, which arrived a day after I purchased my phone. I haven't been to stop admiring the beauty of this phone, Its definitely one of the few mobile phones thatI can see myself holding on to as a collector's item (I simply adore well designed and functioning, cutting edge tech). Having owned they orchid S8+ meant that I was familiar with all the features packed into the S8 series phones. Even still it's a joy to reintroduce myself to these features that still amaze me. The iris scanner has to be one of my favorite biometric tools for securing my phone. It's a great option to have when you may be unable to scan your finger print, or input a pin number. The multiple ways to unlock the S8 is very impressive, and technologywise goes far beyond any other smart phone on the market today. It's great that Samsung is offering theS8 carrier unlocked, which frees consumers from being tethered to one carrier, something extremely important in the US, where the customer service you get can be quite bad from all 4 to 5 of the major carriers. It's a good feeling to know that you aren't obligated to remain with a company that provides poor service. Additionally, Samsung's unlocked phones are sold free of the extra, unnecessary applications that each carrier adds to phones locked on their network. That performance of the S8 phones is matched only by their cutting edge design. You won't find an Android phone that comes close to the high quality performance, and pioneering design of Samsung's flagship embassy phones. The only suggestion I have for current or future owners of Samsung Galaxy phones is to take care of your phone. They are true investments that maintain a high percentage of their original value/price, for years after your initial purchase."
1449,1,Front camera doesn't my expectations. Always blurry selfies
1450,5,This is the most amazing phone I have ever had ! I have not found anything it can't do super fast and smooth I love this phone!
1451,3,"The S8 is a wonderfully sized device that looks great and performs well. Multitasking is helpful, albeit not seamless. But the screen looks great and with a better launcher it works okay and looks nice at first glance. The curved glass doesn't cause touch problems without a glass screen protector. The OS is over-complicated and isn't fun to use. There are too many options, too many intrusions, and Samsung's apps are irritating. The whole point of using Android is customizing the OS to use what we want, and it's near impossible to get by without google or Samsung being rammed in every aspect of the phone. Bixby is absolutely worthless. We have enough assistants and never needed another one. Clearly it's a money grab from Samsung, which makes sense, but if we don't want to use it, we shouldn't have to. The dedicated button is unnecessary and easily bumped during regular use. If I want to use Cortana, I shouldn't be circumvented by Samsung's terrible software."
1452,5,love it its got everything i need at my finger tips
1453,5,"I love this phone infinitely, the curved OLED display, the amazing camera, wireless and fast charging, all of it. The performance of the phone has decreased in a year by a minimal margin but everything else about the phone is worth it's money, I am glad I didn't upgrade to the S8 this year. FIVE STARS MUST BUY!"
1454,2,"I had my previous Blackberry Priv, naked, for a year, with no scratches. I've had this S8 for a month and there are already a handful of (light) scratches. There's nothing else in my pocket, treated well, no drops. While the phone is beautiful, it's horribly manufactured."
1455,5,"I have been with the Samsung family for many years and am never disappointed! Love the new features on the phone. It feels great in your hand , easy to use, awesome camera, great new functions and apps !"
1456,2,"The Glass Screen on this thing is WEEK, VERY WEEK. I have had a a lot cheaper smartphones with tougher screens then this thing. Had it only about 3 months. dropped on concrete twice. the first time only cracked a little. Second time i busted up the side of the screen. Again I've done worse to cheaper phones and didn't even scratch them. And this hunk of just is suppose to have Gorilla Glass. yeah right. Gorilla glass sucks then."
1457,5,"I love this amazing phone, I've tried many phones but the S8 is the chosen one. It's awesome, the curves, the way it feels in the hands. The camera is so impressive, you can take pictures like a pro. I'm proud of it, very proud."
1458,5,"This phone is one of the best ones out there on the market, best Specs, camera, features, screen size, display and tons of features!"
1459,5,I usually get new Galaxy s every time it goes up but this one I love it lots of storage with 32 more gigs I added as SD card !!
1460,1,This is a terrible phone and not worth the price. Buyer Beware!
1461,5,I have multiple SAMSUNG devices including: 2 TVs Blu-ray Sound Bar Multiple previous phones: Galaxy Nexus; GS4; GS5; GS6 This phone is amazing from the DISPLAY to the intuitive functionality. The camera takes pictures that are so realistic that everybody has commented on the quality! I only await for updates to be verified and approved from Verizon.
1462,5,Great Phone! But not happy with Battery life! - But no cell phone is good for that!
1463,5,"S8 camera photos are amazing, I love the quality and enlarge feature in the photo"
1464,5,"10 out of 10. Great all around in all zones performace, design, specs, build quality and more."
1465,4,I must say overall I'm very impressed with this phone. I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 (which was a good phone at the time) so I can appreciate the many upgrades they've incorporated into this one. Organization is simple to do and the speed / performance very impressive. A couple things that I'm having trouble with are the screen seems ultra slick so tapping & holding my finger in place is sometimes difficult and the media volume is not as loud as on my S5. Not quite sure why I'm still fiddling around just to make sure it's not something I'm overlooking. Otherwise a nice phone for work and play.
1466,5,Samsung S8 is exceptionally well built phone and liked it as my daily driver. Only concern I've is the curved screen doesn't let me fit any tempered glass screen protector ....I just want to protect my beloved phone :-)
1467,3,"Screen is definitely the highlight of this upgrade. however, that's about it compared to the very well rounded and capable S7. i will focus on the negatives which is most people care about when considering upgrading: 1. rounded screen looks nice but not very practical. it is slippery and hard to hold on to. i always avoid ""edge"" version of the galaxy phones but with S8, i have no choice. the S8 renders the color in a much warmer manner. it almost feel like used with that yellowish tune on display. 2. Sound quality. i thought this wont be a big deal but i completely changed my mind after comparing my ""old"" phone, the Axon 7 to S8. the speakerphone, headphone and bluetooth experience on Axon 7 is way superior than S8 in both recording and play back. if anything made me start to regret this ""upgrade"", it will be the sound quality. 3. Finger print scanner - no doubt it was a dumb design to put it besides the camera, everyone agreed right? it is also much slower than Axon 7 4. no physical ""home"" keys - it just slows me down in operating the phone. in addition, samsung did't do a good job utilizing the extra space after removing the physical keys. the screen is bigger but the app icons are actually smaller. i was staring at the beautify wall paper and wondering which icon was calendar and which one was calculator. what's the point? 5. software- full of bloat ware as usual. replacement of google now by Bixby and samsung voice recognition was sub-par and the ""smart switch"" app did not work for Axon 7 ."
1468,1,"After purchasing the phone, about one week later phone started to freeze with black screen. Upon continues effort of contacting customer service, technical support, visiting best buy store to talk with Samsung rep to get the phone re-flash, phone continue to freeze with black screen. They do not let me exchange the phone where as they want to return the entire order and reorder from online. But order includes the promotion that i got on the camera and trade-in offer which was no longer available. Hence even upon returning the phone, i would ONLY get the price i paid minus the trade-in offer where i already send my working phone. So in this case, i had no option left but the keep my phone even though its defective and send for repair even within 3 week of purchase. This was a very bad service i receive where phone that is ONLY 2-3 weeks old was not being exchange despite of being defective. This was the first time i purchased from Samsung.com and i have been Samsung phone user ever since Samsung Galaxy S2. I would not recommend anyone to by from online when their is a promotion running because if their is an issue with the phone, it a lose lose situation for the customer."
1469,3,"Let me start out by saying I am a Samsung fan. My profile just showed me that I've registered eleven (11) Samsung products. The S8 is a great phone, and I loved it for about almost an entire week --until it fell once and the screen cracked. My old S5 lasted for years like a champ, so it was extremely disappointing to find this ""new and improved"" model turn out to be so delicate. If I ignore the cracked screen, the S8 is great in its performance, battery life, etc. But it's a shame that you apparently have to put a bulky protector over the good-looking, sleek design in order to protect it. Have read countless other similar stories of other S8 owners having their screens also break due to seemingly basic falls. Hopefully Samsung will do the right thing again and offer to fix the broken screens at little-to-no cost under a semi-recall."
1470,1,"This was the biggest waste of my money. Bixby is just an alternative home page, you can't use maps when the screen is locked. There are less camera options. The s7 edge would have been well worth keeping rather than *upgrading*. Thoroughly disappointed in this premature phone launch."
1471,5,"I have owned the Galaxy S line beginning with the S2 then, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and now the S8. The Galaxy line took a leap of improvement with the realease of the S6. S7 saw improvement upon the S6. But now, WOW. The S8 has all the power you could ask for. Everything, every task is lightning fast thanks to the Snapdragon 835. And the display, nothing else on the market comes close. I am running Bixby Beta and so far it is performing voice commands wonderfully. The S8 and S8+ are the absolute best you can buy. Worth every penny if you can afford it."
1472,1,I only had it 6 days with a casemate cover and cracked on the edge and went across my screen
1473,4,I love my 7 edge... It is the best phone I've ever owned... The only trade I would give is for the Samsung 8... otherwise I will have this phone forever... there isn't anything i can't do with my phone from documents to the most amazing camara..having low light pictures is a life changer to editing pictures. You don't need a camera I have the best on my edge.. I can share from android to iPhone. Watching Netflix is great... fingerprint security... I could go on and on.. the best part..32 gigs of storage built in.. wow I just keep rolling the great futures around in my head.. buy this phone if you want the BEST
1474,1,Worst ever. I would not recommend for anyone. Fingerprint on back side is worst
1475,5,This is my favorite Samsung phone! Would recommend!
1476,1,"The home button is a pain, can't get it to open half the time without a fight. No screen protector available. I am constantly uninstalling apps and reinstalling (not sure what that's about ugh!) , and that's when I can get internet service both with and without WIFI. Definitely thumbs down and not worth the money."
1477,4,"My last phone was a Galaxy SIII so naturally this was quite the upgrade. The screen is clear and bright and I can appreciate the larger size without being too big. Battery life so far has been excellent lasting ~2 days without GPS use or gaming/video. Quick charging with the OEM charger is very fast. The facial recognition is a bit sketchy and I often just use the fingerprint method to unlock. Some complain about placement but I have long fingers so it is not an issue for me. The look and feel is very nice so I opted for a minimalist cover/case, in fact I bought the Samsung brand. This does not include screen coverage or much drop protection but with Gorilla glass I'm not worried and prefer the sleek feel and clean look. Still waiting for my 'Entertainment Pack' (Memory Card, Stand & Netflix).. One more thing, the provided AKG headphones are decent but the controls only offer volume up/down no pickup/hangup button."
1478,1,"This phone has been the biggest pain! I've had two of them and both have had the same problems. Pour bluetooth connection , dropped calls and loss of GPS connection. What a disaster I'm waiting on my third even though I just want a refund for this defective device!"
1479,5,"I thought that the Samsung notes would be the best lines of phones ever, but this S8 Plus takes the cake. This phone is literally the future"
1480,5,I switched from my iphone 7 plus to this samsung galaxy s8 and I couldnt be happier.
1481,4,"So I've had my S8 for about 2 months now and I love the phone. The Bixby app is another story... I did the initial start up of the app, now every time I go into it I have to go through the set up process again. Then the app pops up when it wants. the button is in a place where it's hard not to hit it and the fact that if you touch the left side of the screen it opens Bixby is horrible.... I want to be able to pick up the phone without having it locked and not have this app open by itself. Besides the Bixby app, I love the phone just wish it was bigger ( I really miss the screen from my note edge)"
1482,5,"I upgraded from the Note 5 to the S8 and I am so glad I did! The Note 5 was a great phone, but this S8 is a fabulous upgrade. The UI is so smooth, the battery is phenomenal, the design of the phone is wonderful to hold in your hand and let me not forget about the screen. The phone screen is mesmerizing. Samsung did a great job with this phone. Thanks for making a great phone, Samsung!"
1483,1,The data connection was so bad that any and all apps the used the internet were useless. Owned the device for 5 days and returned it to go back to my s4 because it actually works. This issues is well documented online and has been an issue since the release of the phone.
1484,1,"I won't get into the actual performance or features of the device. I was extremely disappointed to have to return 3 Galaxy S8 devices all for the same red-tinted screen hardware defect. Restocking fees made this process too expensive to continue until I found a device that did not have the defect, so I had to buy a competing phone that was known for not having defects. Again, extremely disappointed at the defects of the S8."
1485,5,"The features, size and performance of this phone is excellent."
1486,5,"Best phone in market as per design, performance and usability"
1487,3,"The phone is beautiful looking but the functioning is slow, and the edge makes it difficult to type any letters on the outskirts of the querty board."
1488,5,I am a big fan of Galaxy line of phones. I was upset with the note 7 issue and was not going to come back to Samsung. I was less than impressed to hear another phone was coming out. I checked out the S8 event and I was like hmmmmm. I was very impressed with all the new features. The display is amazing on this phone. The camera is the best I have seen. The speed of the phone is great. I wish it came with Bixby sense it was promoted during the event. I recommend this phone as I think it is the phone of 2017!
1489,5,Super-mega gorgeous in every single way Go get it guys! :-)
1490,5,"I have apple for a long time, but felt i wanted to taste something new. This phone has so much stronger battery, is more user optimize friendly and has great camera."
1491,1,"I had bought my Samsung S8 for a trip abroad. The phone worked as I had hoped and I couldn't have been more happy with my purchase...up until a few days ago. Unfortunately, the phone fell off a chair where I was seated (about a two foot drop), hit concrete and the screen is now cracked. I dug a little further an it seems I'm not the only one with this issue as the screen durability has come into question by many others. Buyer beware, it will break."
1492,5,"I'm really loving my S8+ so far. The overall design and performance has been great for me so far. Camera I switched from an iPhone 7 Plus which is often touted as having the best camera. I really did love the camera on it but I've actually been more impressed with the camera in the s8 than I was anticipating. The first shot I took with my camera instantly sold me on it. It was a fairly low light show of my new cat and it came out sharp and vibrant. Similar shots taken with my previous phone came out grainy and with colors that weren't very accurate. Performance The performance has been really great so far. I haven't experienced an serious lag or anything. The battery life has been really great. I have to use my personal phone for work purposes throughout the day and I can make it 2 days without charging it. DEX One of the main things that interested me in the S8 is/was Samsung DEX. It's a dock that allows you to hook the S8 to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse and basically makes it function like a desktop computer. It has a special UI that activates when it's plugged into the DEX which closely resembles either Windows or Chrome OS. There are a number of apps that function like a desktop version like Microsoft Office, Gmail, and Chrome or Samsung Interbrowsers. The functionality has been great for me so far. The performance actually seems even better when plugged into the DEX for some reason and I've been especially impressed with the brower performance and smooth scrolling. Many apps only load as small phone sized versions. I'm hoping this will change over time. The biggest disappoitments are video services like Netflix. This would be an ideal use for them for me but they load in a tiny phone sized window and you can't view the video fullscreen. Youtube does work as a desktop version though. Overall, I really love my DEX and look forward to conitnued improvements to it. Overall, this is a really amazing phone and I can't recommend it enough."
1493,3,"I've had my Galaxy S8 for five days, having just upgraded from the Note 4, which I loved. The phone's features, particularly the resolution, security, and ease of use, are remarkable, but I just noticed a small scratch on the screen. The phone is always facing up on my nightstand or is in a special pocket in my purse with no other items. My screen protector is coming in today, but I didn't imagine already getting a scratch. For a phone this high priced, the screen should not be so easily damaged. I have had phones for almost two years with no scratches. Thinking about returning."
1494,5,Pushing a whole new limit on graphics and processing speed. Keep up the good work Samsung!
1495,1,other than having a great camera there isn't anything else worth mentioning i have owned this phone for less than 2 months and the amount of problems I'm having is ridiculous and the problems started maybe a week after purchasing this phone Dropping calls Failing to connect calls regardless of being on wifi calling or network calling Ignore calls on its own fingerprint sensor works only when it wants to Freezes more than a windows 95 pc
1496,5,I love the camera on the S8+ the best. You can do so much more with all the added features and am very happy with all the added features on this product.
1497,5,"Awesome everything, except for texting...I have big fingers."
1498,5,"I have only had it for about a week now but I can already tell its by far the best yet. I have always had the galaxy s phones and I get the new one everytime it becomes available and I keep getting more and more impressed. This phone has major storage, very fast and just an amazing phone all together!"
1499,4,"The best part of this device, which separates it from previous Samsung and most other android and iOS devices is the larger screen size. This larger screen size is not only aesthetically pleasing, but it is far more efficient than physical home and back buttons. The only negative I have with this phone is the lack of a IR blaster. While I know IR blasters are not too popular, it was still very convenient to be able to use my phone as a remote for almost everything. Bring back the IR blasters please."
1500,5,"I love my Samsung Galaxy S8 it has all the features that I look for and more. It's sleek, light and a cool design. I love it."
1501,2,"It's a beautiful phone. No doubt. In throws in some additional gimmicky features such as iris-scan, the heart-rate monitor, and the edge lighting, which are not exactly necessary for a phone, but if you're paying that much for a phone, these become ""nice to have"" features. The curved screen is a little pointless, to be honest, other than being a novelty. In fact, the curved edge creates glare which makes items harder to read when for example the phone is mounted in a car. Some people have complained about the fingerprint scanner's location. It's not ideal, but it has been working okay for me, so far. Android purists such as myself will not be very happy with the following: 1. Some very common widgets simply don't display correctly on this phone. They display perfectly fine on other Android phones, but not on this, possibly due to the aspect ratio. 2. Bixby is awful and unnecessary. It is essentially the re-inventing of the wheel. The fact that it tries to take over existing functionality essentially cripples the phone in doing things which offered better integration had they left it alone. 3. The Launch Bixby button is dedicated to... Bixby - a terrible restriction on the user. 4. The all-white theme that is forced upon the user. This makes notifications indistinguishable. I would not have bothered to write this review and even tolerated some of the other flaws had it not been for the fact that Bixby is being forced on the user. I have lost the tight voice recognition functionality that I used to have with my previous device."
1502,4,"the bluetooth sound broken, the connection to my car is bad"
1503,5,"Had my phone for about 2 wks and I am love with it. Normally I do not do much with a cell phone, but this one is so clear. Beautiful pictures, watching tv on a small screen is really is amazing."
1504,5,This phone is literally the best. Camera is a baee
1505,3,to use hands free calling in my truck and to use my s8+ to play music in my truck does not work the only way to use these in my truck is with an audio cord makes load hissing sound and you can not here it. so I can not use my hands free calling or listen to music have bought new cords nothing tried my wife new S8+ and it does the same thing. Plug in my older 5S and it works fine. I have sent Samsung and email explain this with no answer. so I guess they do not care about costumer service. or satisfaction. the amount of money you pay and get ignored by the company. I will by a different companies product as soon as my contract is up with sprint and I will go to another cell company. quality is no longer a concern on companies.
1506,5,Perfect for many app and practice .........................................................
1507,5,This phone is the best available like every new Samsung Galaxy products that come out. I recommend this to everyone and so do they after seeing it in use.
1508,5,"great battery, great performance, HD display. Loved this product"
1509,5,"I am a bit shaken as I replaced my faithful S5 A with the newest product launched by Samsung. I am not young so, change is not always easy and I took this endeavor with hesitation. Not 24 hours after I did the change, I found that the new S8, apart from being new , is faster and easy to get acquainted with. I am in fact using it with no major issues although, I will have to get acquainted with the many improvements it has"
1510,5,"By far the best phone on the market. I have had many phones, even the fruit types and Samsung by far is the absolute best at design, performance and overall beauty a phone could be."
1511,1,"The LCD on this product is absolutely terrible. The quality is ridiculous. My wife has a massive case on it and accidentally drops it in the parking lot. Once she picked it up the LCD was completely fried. I'm not talking about the glass... the entire LCD is done for. It won't shut off and all I see is a green, fuzzy picture. It honestly reminds me of the TV in Poltergeist, nothing but a bunch of white noise. Seriously, why do I pay so much for such a piece of junk?"
1512,5,"I love my S8. All the cool features I'm still learning what most can do, but so far excellent! The edge app took some getting used to, but once you customize it, it couldn't be better! I waited over a year to get a new phone, I'm so glad I did!! I love it!"
1513,5,"The physical design of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is obviously fantastic (let's do something about that fingerprint sensor next time..), but it is the seamless integration of Android Nougat and the Samsung UI that really enhances this handset. Couple this experience with the Samsung Galaxy-specific apps that are available to turbo-charge certain features, tools and use-cases, and you have an amazing powerful and beautiful device, even before you get into the 3rd party app ecosystem. The customization potential is so expansive, and the UI, camera interface and AMOLED screen improvements are just what we wanted. This is by far the best phone I've ever used!"
1514,5,Love it it's a. Beautiful phone and great for anything you need
1515,5,"Outstanding, mind blowing, Crisp Sharp Display Samsung has done it again they have given us a phone worth bragging. Thank You Samsung Galaxy for life"
1516,4,"Phones great. Though when S7 came out, suddenly mine didn't want to work right"
1517,5,"I am a previous iPhone user and this is the first time I have switched to an android, based on my friends and family's recommendations. I have to tell anyone who is thinking twice about switching that they will not be disappointed. This phone has the performance and the battery life that supersedes iPhone's battery life by far. Yes, it is based on use but let me tell you, I have my phone on hotspot for most of the day, talk and text for the majority of the day, and the battery lasts me for almost 44 hours. I was always worried that the phone is going to drain the battery and I will have to carry additional chargers and battery packs to charge my phone, but, I am extremely satisfied with my first ever android."
1518,5,This is a fast and sleek phone with a great camera
1519,5,Love it has amazing user experience easy to control and understand
1520,5,"This is the best phone I have ever used, hands down beating every other iteration of Samsung Galaxy phones I have used. I used S2 then S4 and now this. It feel like I have the power to be like wonder woman with this phone! Wow!"
1521,1,"Took the S8 by the pool side to take some photos and videos. Next day, screen started to flicker, and stopped working. I believe the phone still works, just not the screen."
1522,5,Best phone and tech/support ever! Very user friendly and intuitive. Great features all around and the camera is amazing! Screen is crystal clear. Best phone I have ever purchased. This is like the Lamborghini of phones.
1523,5,"This is a cool phone. Feels good, nice curved edges."
1524,5,The experience from out of the box till now has been far better than we expected.
1525,5,There is so much to customize and its completely durable but still looks great. Thank you Samsung
1526,1,"Hey I'll rate it higher when it works as advertised. As of June 5, 2017 the unlocked S8+ cannot use the GEAR VR. The Samsung server does not accept the model number of the phone (such as SM-G955U1). You will get NETWORK ERROR forever until they fix it. You will go insane trying to find someone to help you, total waste of your time. But you can try just to let them know another person is angry and annoyed."
1527,5,"this phone is almost perfect, except for the quirky finger print scanner. The location is irritating. Other than that, the phone is a great size, easy to carry, Best screen on the planet on any phone period. I bought this and the gear 3 watch. Great pair to get together, worth the money."
1528,5,"Very powerful, fast, and great camera. Only setback is that bixby voice isn't ready yet."
1529,5,so far so good.... we'll see what happens on the coming months
1530,4,It is a great phone with excellent features and apps
1531,5,I'm very happy that I updated to the S8. That battery life is EXCELLENT. I manage social media and digital marketing. Having a lot of apps that are normally draining for the battery is a MUST to do my job. The S8 handles that beautifully. It's ver responsive and intuitive. Thank you Samsing!
1532,5,I love my new GS8 plus easy to use and most of all love the camera. I had GS5 before and I use it to take pictures in Las Vegas at night and it did a good photo than my iPad4. I've been torn between iPhone7 and GS8 plus but at the end I chose GS8+. Happy I did. Hard to put a screen protector so I bought a case with built in screen protector and so far it's working very well.
1533,5,A Must Buy! Everything from design to display to battery life is awesome.
1534,5,This phone is everything and more that a person would need to do anything watch your shows pay for something play games the best pictures ever most cameras cant do what this phone does. Best phone I've ever owned
1535,5,"Before I review I must say that I am a former iPhone user. I had and iPhone for about 3 years. This year in 2017 I purchased the Galaxy s8 and I was very impressed. The design of the phone is so clean, so attractive. The display is what takes the cake! it's so eye catching and puts out amazing views. It is hands down the best display on a phone. Now the Samsung UI is great I love the features, it makes my life easier. Switching to the GS8 was an excellent investment for me. There are so many things I can say about this phone but to narrow it all down, this phone is on a whole other galaxy!"
1536,1,I had it for less then 24 hours. Bent over to pick up my car keys and it slid out of my front pocket and hit the ground about 18 inches off the ground. Thank God i had insurance.
1537,5,I've had it a week now I absolutely love it. Easy to access all applications. Photos are true colors.
1538,5,This product has great features. I love Samsung!!!
1539,5,"I love my new Samsung Galaxy 8. I can use it with one hand, fits perfect in my pockets and uniform. I had the edge but was a bit too big but this one is perfect. it takes awesome pictures. I recommend the galaxy s8 to everyone."
1540,5,I got my phone about a week ago I have not dropped it and there is certain parts on the screen that do not work right. I will touch one icon on the screen and it will register that i touched another. The edge of the screen will register everyonce and awhile that im touching it when im not.
1541,4,"I was initially disappointed with there not being a removable power source, but the battery seems to hold up quite well with constant use. call quality is also a huge improvement from my last phone. Does what a phone should do... and does it well"
1542,4,"Love this new 'friend'! I was an iPhone client but now I see, feel, and love the change. I am a believer!"
1543,5,Thank you for having me able to use S6 device. it looks good with great features.
1544,5,Love this phone! Fr the design to the software to that SCREEN! Simply the best.
1545,4,"Great hardware and design, however the basic functionality of a cell phone is hindered with button placement (Bixby button could have been dedicated to audio down or removed all together) and inaccurate screen feedback (swiping between news articles and texting). The battery life is not a large problem which is good because the screen is great, which compliments the volume. The sound quality could be improved by an equalizer, I miss my HTC with Beats audio, but it is loud enough to power a decent set of headphones. What is the purpose of Bixby again?"
1546,4,"Hello, The best thing what i love about the phone is the Screen - Curved Display. Battery works well. More than a day . Built quality is superb."
1547,4,"I just got my new Samsung S8 phone after a 2 year contract with iphone and I'm loving it. More robust capability, supports more applications and e'm excited to explore more features. Hope it will continue to impress me : )"
1548,5,I used to have an iPhone and this is my first android and I love it so far be problems.
1549,5,Lots of customization options. System updates are fast.
1550,4,"April 25th 1977. It was there I saw this phone in my future. I recently upgraded from my old & tired Galaxy S4 to a new S8. So far so good... I haven't been confused by anything [yet] . It's pretty seamless... all the ""Samsung Language"" is still the same.... I love the hidden side bar menus ...It's just swipe and go from multi screen"
1551,1,"Because the screen is long, video do not take up the whole screen. So, therefor, you actually have a smaller phone display, versus the advertise display. Missing Private File feature Bixby is horrible outside button is only for Bixby, and cannot change to another app, (e.g. google, facebook ect) Battery last a day at $750, why not add a $15 charging deck Battery is molded to the unit, therefor, I cant carry extra batterys cant remove preloaded aps"
1552,5,"This has been one of the best phones I have seen on the Market lately. The camera graphics are superior, the Battery last longer, and the security features, including retina and face recognition, surpass all others out there on the market. Finding apps is also easier with, not only the apps on the preferred screens when you swipe left to right, but also the ability to find the app alphabetically when you swipe down. The phone does not heat up like its predecessor either. The outright purchase of the phone was slightly cheaper than when I paid my previous phone in full."
1553,5,Love it. The best phone i ever had.Samsung keep up the good work.
1554,5,"I just got my new phone, it looks and feels great. Looking forward to get acquainted with all of its features!"
1555,5,"Thin. big beautiful high definition screen. Multiple security options for signing into your phone. Many features to include connecting with other devices such as T.V.s, cars, and other smart enabled products. Easy transfer of data from old phone. Easy to use. Just all around awesome phone."
1556,4,great phone. better than iphone. I wish OS updates didnt bog down older phones
1557,5,"Extremley satisfied with the galaxy s8. It's hands down the best phone I've ever had, the user-friendly operating system and accessibility are what most iPhone users dread.... fear not this phone blows away anything else. Durable, sleek and seamless design, amazing definition and picture quality...overall I rate this device a 9/10. Great job samsung."
1558,5,"just bought my new s8 today, from the t mobile store. i couldnt be any happier. awesome phone and service."
1559,5,Phone has a beautiful design. A bit worried about how sturdy it is with the rounded screen. But no problems yet. Had it 1 month. Good battery life. Upgraded from an S6 so all the great Samsung features in a pretty package.
1560,5,I would say an amazing device with lot of new things coming in. Although switching from IPhone I am finding the interface a bit lengthy which will be taken care of I am sure. But the bunch of features and quality of display is way ahead and best in all of the present devices in the market. I am very excited to have such a beautiful device with bunch of features and looking forward to utilize it full.
1561,5,"Samsung has been my fav since many years ago, and it's still finds its way to become better."
1562,5,"I finally made the decision to switch from the iPhone 7 Plus to the Galaxy S8 for a few simple reasons: 1) the display on the S8 is in a class of its own (like my curved 4k tv) 2) the accessories exceed Apple - the VR Gear is a must have and it's my 3rd pair although I kept the iPhone on as my phone 3) did not know that the android store had better apps and different apps than the apple App Store It wasn't an easy decision, in fact, it took me 2 more iPhones to realize I was missing out on something I didn't want to anymore so I dumped the apple for the galaxy s8!"
1563,4,"Just like the review title implies, it took a bit of time before I accepted the fact that this phone is ""allight, at first I was like, ""This phone sucks, forced to buy a new phone, my old phone galaxy s5, went down for the count, it was out cold, wouldn't even hold enough charge to power up. This new s8+ has some decent qualities and some programming that sucks, pretty much takes control of preference, you have to give permission to pretty much everything before it let's you do simple preference displays, or other tasks. S8+ new version of screen shots is nice though, it not only screen shots the image, but being able to follow a link off of your gallery is cool. Nice big screen, great camera, over all, up to date smart phone, just would prefer more control over what my display screens display, without having to turn over all my privacy to Samsung, kinda forces you to turn over your privacy if you want to take full advantage of it's features, needs more options to say no Samsung your not allowed access, and then be able to use that feature anyways. Since a bit of time has come to be, my personal opinion of this phone (S8+), is, ""It's allight"", and yes Samsung, your allowed access to that opinion."
1564,1,I love the phone. I've had it for less than a month and it is already randomly restarting on me. While using the phone in normal operation the phone will freeze and the screen will black out. At first I thought I locked the screen but then eventually the phone starts booting up. Hope they address this issue.
1565,4,The S8+ is the greatest phone by far. Hands down. The size of the screen conpensates the price tag. Can we still call this a phone its defenetly way more than that.
1566,5,"The phone has quick speeds,great camera, and long battery life. There are so many options and features it is taken me awhile to figure out. I do have a problem with sending emails but need to contact customer support to figure out."
1567,5,Phone is sleek and has extra sleek design and excellent screen display. The phone is also fast and very easy to hold with one hand. Elegant design!!
1568,5,Look and feel of the phone is great. Its very eye catchy. Absolutely recommend to anyone
1569,4,Super awesome phone. Great features and easy to use.
1570,5,"exelent phone,very fast,bright screen.great features,"
1571,4,its all good. I owned S7 previously and can immediately see the improvements this model offers.
1572,3,"The interface on the Samsung Edge 7 has been tweaked until the point is it plain unfriendly. (Running Android 7.0 / Nougat) Before all the useless ""improvements"" to the interface, I could quickly re-call a dropped call by a single push of a button. Now, I have to fumble around, hit the name I want to call, look at the lightly-labeled drop-down menu, and look for a tiny little phone receiver symbol to recall. There used to be a bold, well-displayed list of recent calls on Galaxy phones. Now I must look through hard-to-see lists underneath two tabs, then select ""Recent"" vs ""Contacts."" If i wanted to look for a list of contacts, I would hit the contact book icon. I just want a straight shot at re-calling someone with one button click. The Edge 7 has also made me unhappy with the inability to select whether an app goes to the internal storage or the SD/card. Every time I update the apps, I must then go through the entire moving of app or app storage to the card. This week, it started giving me a black screen and that is unacceptable if you need to turn off a ringer in a meeting. My Edge 7 gets hot for unknown reasons and slower with every update. The battery is draining faster than it should. I have have cleaned up my system cache file and the app cache files. The only thing I haven't done on this phone is a factory reset. It's wasted enough of my time. I will soon go get another phone that just WORKS. Two years ago, I bought a Nexus as my housephone when I purchased a Project Fi phone number and service. It glides along like a dream. No bloatware. No heating up. Never stutters. It's running Nougat, too. Yet, I can call anyone with ONE click of a large button! So, I know that phones can be better than Samsung's offerings. I will hate to leave. I was a diehard...I had a Galaxy, Galaxy 2, then Notes 2,3,and 4, and finally, the fateful Note 7, then STILL I stayed with Samsung and took the Edge 7 until the Note 8 would come out. But, in the last six months, Samsung has turned into a phone that isn't anything like the reason I have bought them for nearly a decade. Sure, I still WANT a Note 8, but I know it will be another phone where with each update it slows down and the menus are so fancy you can't see them. It will come with the overly-improved interface on the latest Android OS and it will be stuffed to the gills with unwanted apps that slow down my phone. It's time to go with an LG, a Pixel, another Nexus...anything but the pretty, bloated line of Samsung phones with diminishing functional abilities."
1573,1,I've had this phone barely a month. It has been in a case since day 1. It took a 2 foot accidental fall of the couch the other day and the screen cracked. This is the most fragile phone that I have EVER owned. I wish I had never bought it and will make sure to let everyone I know not to get one. I will switch over to an iPhone as soon as I have a chance. So completely disappointed to spend this kind of money on a phone that can't handle even a slight drop IN A CASE!!!
1574,3,"Every time Samsung releases a new Galaxy, I buy it hoping that this time it will be great. Disappointed again. Screen is dull, hard to see at all in sunlight. Retina scan nor the face recognition is worth much as neither function with any regularity. Camera is nothing to write home about. Sound is just plain bad. Side menu is pointless. I imagine this will be my last attempt with the Galaxy line. Long on promise, short on delivery."
1575,5,I love my Samsung S8! Only have had about a month and still finding new features. Battery lasts longer than my old phone. Just love it!
1576,4,I love the camera. The retina scan to unlock the phone is cool also.
1577,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a great smartphone to have and it has many great features. Some features that stand out is the camera and the display.The camera in the Galaxy S8 is amazing during the day and night. The display is big and the phones body is not to big. the performance is outstanding. I recommend this phone to anyone who is looking to get a new phone.
1578,1,"This phone has glitch after glitch with it, from freezing to now, me only being able to use it on speaker phone...... as far as customer service, you might as well briing a lunch if you are waiting on someone to answer the phone... wait time is always 30 mins plus...... I preordered the phone and was suppose to recieved the free VR goggles with my order.... its been two months and i have as yet to get them..... I will give this phone one plus, it has the best battery life of any Samsung phone i have ever owned..... this being my fifth one...... I will never order straight from Samsung again, will instead get it from Tmobile."
1579,5,Very good battery life. Fast recharge. Very bright and clear screen.Good reception and voice quality.
1580,4,"I stepped down, in screen size, from the note 4. Admittedly I haven't owned this phone long but this far I am highly impress by the battery life and speed."
1581,5,Good Phone easy to use and nice quality. Long battery.
1582,5,I love this phone. Ive had it for two yrs now and my 11 month old loves it. It has gone through dtop aftet drop and still wprks great. I just wish the screan was a little bigger.
1583,5,Seems like a fantastic phone so fare wife has one and loves it
1584,5,"This phone met all my expectations. Infinity screen is awesome, great size and weight. Lot of usable features that make this phone a great experience to use."
1585,5,I personally love android devices and even have tried Apple devices. The Galaxy S7 easily outdoes any iphone. All of my androids would and have. So i give this product a 10 out of 10
1586,5,"I have had a Samsung phone since the S2 and they just keep getting better. I love the size, feel and speed of this S8. I have multiple Samsung products from tablets to headphones. Kudo's to you Samsung! You will not find anything better than Samsung, stop looking this is what you need."
1587,5,"There's not much to say, Samsung delivered what it promised. Simply amazing!"
1588,5,"I would highly recommend the Galaxy S8 and S8+. The size of the S8 is amazing, the clarity on the screen is as crisp as can be and the infinity screen is off the hook. Best phone Samsung came out with. And that is why I am a loyal customer of Samsung. I also own other Samsung products as well (oven and tv) Nice job Samsung - thank you."
1589,5,"As of 05/08/2017, this phone has the best processor on the market (snapdragon 835), and is a really slick design. Comparing the S8 to any other phone aesthetically is impossible. It is just beautiful. The fingerprint reader is not great on this model, however, and the eye and iris scanner could use some improvement. My battery life is only okay. But its pros more than make up for its cons - this is definitely the phone to have."
1590,5,"Love everything about this phone except the buttons get in my way when I use the landscape mode and, like most phones, the back is too slippery and needs rubber strips or something to keep it from sliding from your hand so easily. It looks sleek and stunning but slippery is not a good trait on a products that are as pricey as these hand-held gadgets and a bit of practicality is a useful thing in product design. I love the water resistant feature of the S8+ but I haven't had it long enough to know how well the unchangeable battery is going to hold up over time. The phone is remarkably light and hand-friendly. I'm a Samsung fan moving from a Note4, which has really held up well, so I hope the quality of this phone holds up as well over time. I recommend the S8+ if you're looking for speed, good looks, and the Samsung experience."
1591,3,This is a great phone EXCEPT that it keeps restarting this is frustrating. I googled it yesterday and found there are many people experiencing the same issue and exchanging the phone does not stop the problem. I do like the phone but wish I would have waiting a few months before upgrading to it. I'm going to try returning it tonight and going back to my Edge until they get this problem solved.
1592,5,Galaxy S8+ exceeds my expectations loved the full screen mode while recording and Bixby vision was really useful in finding the product or figuring out what it is. The eye scanner is pretty accurate and helpful in unlocking the phone.
1593,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is by far the best phone I've ever owned. Finally, Samsung has fully matched or exceeded Apple in every conceivable area. Of particular note are the camera and display. Unbelievable. Great job Samsung on this product. Now, please improve your customer service and support."
1594,5,This is the best smartphone on the market. Thank you Samsung for always delivering the most and best technology out there.
1595,5,Lots of Great features. This is the Smartest phone I've had and I'm still learning my way around. I love it!
1596,5,"I'm very pleased with the overall size of my Galaxy S8. The screen size is perfect for gaming on the go, as well. It's battery life is amazing, and the overall build quality is superb."
1597,5,"I have been a Samsung user for many years now and this phone never disappoints. The only thing is you have to be careful to protect the phone. It is very fragile. My phone flipped out of my hand and landed on carpet and the back sustained a crack on it. Because it is made of glass, you have to be careful or it will not last long. I have always taken great care of my phones and my Samsung G5 still looks out of box new. But the features that this SG8 comes packed with are awesome. The infinity screen is amazing . Thanks Samsung for making a great phone."
1598,5,Awesome phone. Been a Samsung user since the S 3. Love the new design. Best phone yet!
1599,5,"I love the pictures, and the one in front too, good cuality"
1600,4,"I am new to this phone from an S2 which I loved and got to digest it completly . Its been only 2 weeks appears to have a lot of great features and potentials...A bit complicated,however I am sure itwill ease with time"
1601,5,I love this phone SamSung has never let me down good phone
1602,5,Excellent quality pictures. Lightweight. I love my new phone.
1603,5,the s8 is more than i had hoped for!!!!!! excellent phone!!!
1604,5,"I have had all three curved screen phones S6 edge, S7 edge and S8+. I have yet to have any issues with screens as stated in a couple reviews I have read. The screens are tough and don't scratch easily. I did have a cracked screen on my S6 but any other brand would have been broken much worse. The phone still functions perfectly even with the cracks. I am very hard on my phones working and dropping the phone every day. Why would anyone ever use a smart phone without a protective case. Which brings me to complaints about finger prints on the back glass not a problem on any phone I have ever had. All my phones have been protected by a case. If you want to show off the beauty of your phone get one of the clear cases that are available then you have the best of both worlds. As for the fingerprint scanner it is in the perfect space, much better placement than other phones I have tried with the scanner in the middle area of the back. As for putting smudges on the camera lens that is pretty hard to do unless you have peanut butter and jelly on your finger. I have tried to smudge my camera lens with just my finger and cannot smudge it to any degree that would ever cause a lack of picture quality. My opinion is people will complain about just about anything if its a valid complaint or not. As for locating the scanner without looking it is very easy to locate if you are right handed, it may be a different story if you are a lefty but I don't know about that. My case has a beveled edge near the scanner that makes it extremely easy to place your finger on the scanner. The iris scanner is the best method to use but everyone has their preferences. The plus size is not that large and easy to use with one hand or well with my hands anyway which are of normal size. It took me a while to warm up to no home button but I'm getting use to using the power button to open and close my desktop. While I'm on the home button I don't see where eliminating it gave any more screen area. The area where the button was is now taken by the on screen buttons so that area of the screen is still taken up by buttons. It does look much sleeker and modern but didn't give any more usable screen space. As for Bixby or the lack there of, I'm not getting it. I don't see Bixby ever being anything better than Goggle assistant so what's the big hoopla. At this point it's nothing more than another widget that I'll never use. The Bixby button should have been the new home button. Maybe Samsung will pull it off but I don't see it being anything to hold your breath on. I have an issue with the S8 using Samsung Pay, it just doesn't work anymore. I am a big user of Samsung Pay but with my new phone it's not working, I always get your card is declined, very disappointing. Now I'm back to using my card and loosing points on Samsung Pay. It is still working on my other phone but not the S8, it is so hit or miss I have given up entirely I hate holding up the line, very disappointing. Even the latest update that was just pushed down has not fixed the issue. The phone battery is average on usage, better than my S6 worse than my S7 but it last most the day and I don't play games or do other heavy usage and screen is turned down. With always on display turned on it makes it through the day but not much more than that. I have turned off always on display and have about 40 percent at around 6pm. Fast charge has always been a plus on all my S phones and wireless charging charges in good time. The phone is fast and works smooth it's the best performance I have seen on any phone. I do like the new phone and feel it is the best thing going at this point in time. I have no worries about the battery it's a shame they had the Note 7 problem and I get tired of people asking aren't you afraid the phone is going to blow up. Bye Bye Samsung phones if that happens, so I'm pretty sure they have done everything to make their batteries trouble free. I've had my S7 for a year or so and it has had no problems with screen performance or battery so I'm 100 percent confident that the S8 is going..."
1605,5,We are big advocates of the Samsung products. These phones are no exception. We have been both impressed and completely satisfied with their products!
1606,1,Clunky is the best word for it. The new features are a joke. The Interface is slow and annoying constantly needing to hit a button 2 or three times. And the curved edges effect typing. Extremely regret getting the s8
1607,4,"I've had it for one day, and you can tell the difference!"
1608,5,"My wife and I both upgraded our phones to the new S8 and we absolutely love them. The style, graphics, desing, everything is awsomse. Only thing is buy a case because its pretty sljppery but other than that its amazing."
1609,5,Best phone ever. Would definitely recommend this phone
1610,5,"This Samsung Galaxy S8 is the greatest piece of technology I own to this day, and I do have serveral lol. But from the design of the phone, the performance, and all around ease of use all while being simplistic yet sophisticated, IT IS FANTASTIC. My first Samsung Galaxy phone was the S3, from there I fell in love with Samsungs' design, functionality, and customization as compared to other big name brand companies, I'd take a Samsung every single time. The S8s' display is super clear, crisp, bright, and eye catching. Watching videos are wonderful and picture quality is outstanding. Samsung did a brilliant job with this phone and I am so glad that I purchased it. Keep Up the Amazing Work Samsung! I'll be a customer for life."
1611,5,"This phone is amazing. It's slick, fast and gorgeous. The display is great, even if you use the standard setting instead of enhanced. Bixby: Bixby has a long way to go to replacing already-existing assistants on the market. It's too early in development to really comment on whether this will become a commonly used application. Security: I'm not completely inconvenienced by the fingerprint scanner, but when I can avoid it I much prefer to use the iris scan. It actually works rather well and saves me the hassle of searching for the scanner, and it's more secure. Battery: The battery life is decent, but the power-saving mode is awesome. My phone lasted on single charge, from 3AM until 10PM, mid-power-save mode, and still had plenty of juice left if I'd needed it. I wasn't heavily using it (during that time I took some photos, chatted on messenger, and browsed social media sites) but I've had plenty of phones die on me with little to no use just due to how long I'd gone without a charge. It's also really convenient to turn on and off, right there in your quick action tray. Speakers: The speakers are decent but I'm not thoroughly impressed. I much prefer using my headset or a bluetooth speaker when available. That being said, dual bluetooth support is an exciting new feature I can't wait to try out. Camera: Great quality and tons of new fun and useful features. Definitely a must-have as phones have replaced the standard digital camera. Overall, I love this phone and it's definitely worth the upgrade. It may not be perfect, but it is easy to overlook the few imperfections."
1612,4,Can't say much as it is a new device and I have much to learn. I had the GS5 and now the GS8. I need more info to help with the use of this device.
1613,5,"The infinity display in the first glance seems great and attracts me. Methods for unlocking the phone are incredible and so fast. It made working with the phone so much easier. Totally, int the first impression is lovely."
1614,4,so far so good quick charge is good nice look and feel
1615,5,this the best off samsung....for now...keep doing it
1616,5,I received Samsung S8 Today and I have started loving it. The feel in hand is great. The screen is big while phone size is still same as Galaxy S6. Lot other features. Still exploring
1617,5,I think this is a wonderful device. Iy runs very fast and has great design. I wish it's wireless charger worked with a case on it.
1618,5,"Easy to use, love the design. I think the size is perfect. I like the fact that the home button is part of the screen."
1619,5,"I can believe the camera and its software, the selective focus, I can use my own ISO as I am a professional. Besides the quantity of different designs and set up options to make it your own. Unbelievable Happy after all."
1620,5,"As a 10 years iPhone user, just switched to see what is this all about. All I can say WOW. Amazing phone. Great features. Simply a great phone."
1621,5,"Galaxy s8+ is arguably the best looking phone out currently. And feels great in my hands. The screen is out of this world and I have a hard time taking my eyes off of it. This is my first Samsung android phone. I've always had iPhones but with release of the s8 I just had to give it a try. So far I am not regretting that decision one bit. I was afraid the switch would be painful especially with my entire family on iPhones but the switch was actually very smooth. So far loving the design, screen, camera, performance... don't really have any major gripes. One minor thing is the face recognition does not work reliably, more often than not it does not recognize me. I have tried to recapture my face multiple times in different light settings but it still does not work 100%. But does not bother me much as I'm mostly using the fingerprint and smart lock(great feature!)."
1622,5,I wish my TV had the same infinity screen. its as if you are seeing past the video..So easy to take pics now with the ability to increase lighting without sunlight is awesome. Love my phone and can't wait for my VTR googles....thanx
1623,5,"So these days its getting harder and harder to get excited about a new cell phone. They have all started to look much the same and there haven't been any really out of this world additions in several years. That being said I would say this is the best-looking phone out currently and the specs equally are better than anything else out there as a holistic package. Sure a camera here might be better, or the screen more durable, but all things included this is the best there is as of today. I like that they stuck with the water resistance and that the drop protection has been enhanced a bit more than the last two models. In fact while getting used to the new phone (and before I put a skin on the back) the thing slipped out of my hand twice. It was pretty without any protection but WAY too slippery...once it landed onto a concrete floor the other time onto a tile floor with no damage noted. I have since installed a grippier skin on the back. The only complaint I have is the fingerprint scanner having been put on the back. When the phone is on a table or desk, with my S6 I could unlock it without having to pick it up. Now I have to deal with the unlock code or I have to pick it up...neither of which is as convenient. Anyway...all in all very happy (sans the fingerprint scanner) and I would definitely buy this phone again."
1624,5,i am loving this phone. nothing bad to say about it
1625,5,"Never disappointed. One of the reasons I've been a long Samsung (product) consumer, they're ability to impress me with each product release. I've owned, or maintained, all Samsung smartphones starting with the S4 and the S8 is the best one yet."
1626,5,upgraded from S5 to S8 so smooth and fast! The best phone yet!
1627,5,"I really like Samsung products, 2 thumbs up on all of your products."
1628,4,My S7 gets hot even from just being on standby and in my pocket. The earbuds also suddenly stopped working and they are not even four months old.
1629,5,After the Note 7 debacle it was kind of hard to go back to Samsung. I never had any issues with my Note 7 but the whole return process sucked. The S8 is awesome though and I still recommend Samsung. The camera is great the screen is great I have no complaints.
1630,5,I have no complaints as far as the operating system and ease of use. Only major complaint I have that I didn't know about before purchasing it was that the back is covered with a Glass Screen as well. I shattered the back within the first few days of having it. Sadly. The S7 and S6 had a metal back which in my Opinion was a much better design.
1631,5,Love this phone display is insane and it is rocking a lot of raw power
1632,5,"This is the 3rd Galaxy phone I have had and I am so happy with it! It is always easy to integrate all my apps and updating stuff is a breeze. I have plenty of space for all my apps and pictures! The camera is fantastic, as well! I have been a Samsung fan for years and I don't plan to stop anytime soon!"
1633,5,Phone looks amazing and the features are amazing!! 5 out of 5!!
1634,5,"I've been always been fan of Samsung galaxy phones. I had my galaxy s5 for 3yrs and know that I have the s8 , huge difference. Im in love with the new s8!."
1635,4,"my samsung galaxy S8+ fits perfect in my hand without being to big. It also takes wonderful pictures, with many option to choose from for editing."
1636,5,This phone is the best phone money can buy and I first hand can tell you this phone is not big at all .
1637,5,"Not unlike but more e than with previous years, it's likely to be the best phone for most users."
1638,5,"My last phone was a Google Nexus 6 (Motorola). I loved that phone, full 6"" screen. But S8+ is 6.2"". At first having it so tall but narrow was very strange for me, but I actually love how much easier it is to hold, and smaller in my pocket. The phone is just so fast, 4GB RAM and great processor. Camera is amazing (and the Nexus 6 was very good) but this is so much better. I love the iris recognition, works perfectly, and even my son who looks exactly like me can't fool it. Very intuitive and easy to use, love the native email app which is even better than the paid apps I have used for my work Exchange account. In my past Samsungs I didn't like the Samsung apps but I really like these apps. The infinity screen is just awesome, nuff said! Can save RAW camera files."
1639,3,"It has a lot of storage including the external microchip.. not sure why Samsung has changed the charging cable.. yea higher speed of charge but was really nice to have a single cable for various products. One really big issue is that there is no protective glass screens that work well with this phone so gotta be extra careful. The plastic one semi works but the glass ones do not as you lose most of your touch capability. Looks great, ease of use and love being able to reach both sides with one hand."
1640,5,"The phone has a great feel to it and looks great especially the Orchid Gray with a clear case. The rounded edges make the screen fun to look at and easy to hold. The only drawback that I can see is that the price was a bit more that I wanted to spend, but the phone so far has exceeded my expectations."
1641,5,I've always loved Samsung phones I had the note 4 & 5. And just recently switched to the s7 edge. Everyday I learn new tricks it does! Never been dissapointed. I'm super happy i got the extra storage room back because i do take a lot of pictures. Keep making awesome phones samsung! Maybe just come down some on the $
1642,5,"I only had my phone a few days now, but I am loving it. Great battery life, and lots of storage."
1643,3,"I've been waiting to upgrad my S6 but after 4 days, the S8 is by far the most initially frustrating to me. I've always had Samsung Galaxy phones (S3 through S6) & this is my least favorite upgrade. It's got all of the amazing normal features like best quality camera, etc, but I don't like the lack of home button, or the option to have normal vs edge, & while you can change the clock format on the always on display, it won't change on the normal lock screen (and if you're type A maybe a little OCD, that will drive you nuts). My biggest complaint though is the button sensitivity - you can change home button sensitivity but whether I'm typing or scrolling for normal everyday use, I feel like I'm going to break the screen because I have to press so hard & it takes me twice as long to type or even play solitaire because it skipped a letter or something. Also, while I realize most people want the uber slim design, I wish the S8 had width of the S8+ but height of the S8. Overall, awesome phone but my initial excitement of my upgrade is disappointing."
1644,5,wow I'm amazed with battery life and its look. all my friends with other branded phones love the look and feel.
1645,4,I like it so far still learning. I brought it a couple weeks ago and still getting use to the phone
1646,5,"I've used so many phones from galaxy y to galaxy note series. After the Note 7 issues, I almost moved to iPhone. I used iPhone for a month and had to stop using it because I didn't liked it. Galaxy S8 is the best smart phone I've ever used. Absolutely loved it. Camera is humongously awesome."
1647,1,This was a horrible phone from the start. I thought it was great when I first purchased it and was looking at it in the store however I was terribly wrong. DQA not responding after the first update was just annoying and then the screen cracks without even dropping it when it was protected with an Otterbox case that has even been tested on the phone. Not worth the money and would have kept my S7 edge if I knew I was going to have these problems. Definitely a manufacturer defect not a accidental damage. I have protected and taken exceptional care of all my phones and this is the first phone that has ever cracked on me and like I said I did not even drop it. Flawed design and even worse is customer service refuses to replace it even after only 10 days.
1648,4,"Phone is great, only downfall is the battery drains quickly even when i turn the resolution down,bluetooth, wifi, etc etc. But great phone"
1649,5,I had this phone for only a day and already fell in love! I like how the fingerprint sensor is in the back now. Its a very nice and creative design!
1650,5,This product is amazing in all the right way. It has a huge screen. Love the tutorial.. helps me learn how to use my phone perfectly. It's a beautiful phone with curved edges that fit perfect in the palm of your hand.
1651,4,"To be honest the overall of a 4 is rather harsh considering my reasons. My two main reasons for the 4 rating are that they don't have gifs built into the Samsung keyboard as well as the overall price. Every other Android Phone I have ever had, has had the gifs built into the keyboard and it is one of the weirdest, but also my favorite things about owning an android phone vs a iPhone. However, everything else is spot on. The phone is lightning fast, battery life is awesome, and the fingerprint reader that everyone seems to complain about really isn't in as bad of a location as they make it out to be. Once you get used to it you hardly notice it. I can understand for people that take lots of pictures because you do accidentally touch the camera lens using it but it really isn't noticeable for me. I am overall very happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend it to a friend"
1652,5,Nothing compares to its exterior design. Highly recommend.
1653,3,"Display screen does not allow for a full photo screen display as does the Galaxy S5. Thinner model but have not found a case that covers the front screen. The ""Edge"" feature is similar to Windows 8 side panels which I have never been fond of. Screen for pictures, resolution is great. Not sure at this point if it is worth the expense."
1654,1,"I originally liked my phone out of the box. Then, I noticed the red tint of the display. It was bad, especially on white backgrounds. Support had me try color adjustments, but it didn't work. Sadly, I had to return my phone for a refund. I purchased the phone from Samsung's site as a pre-order and paid extra for the full VR experience kit. Which meant I had to return everything. I will definitely not be re-ordering a phone from Samsung with the loss of that kit. What a waste of my time and a big disappointment."
1655,5,"Only had this phone for a week now, but I love it. Great Phone, features, and sleek design."
1656,5,"I love my new phone so glad, I decided to stay with Samsung."
1657,5,"I love the way it unlocks with face recognition so I can unlock it hands free! It's also waterproof and durable so it takes the worries of damage away. I'm getting to know my phones assistant, Bixby, and she's getting to know me too. The colors and clarity of pictures is amazing! I really want the Gear VR headgear to go with it."
1658,5,Great product Just left an iPhone and k don't miss it
1659,5,"Absolutely love this phone. I've had the Galaxy S3 for my first smart phone and I loved that one. From there till now I had to other phones, but still wasn't happy till now that I'm back to my Galaxy S8+. This phone is awesome to watch videos on. Full screen view is amazing, split screen is easy to use with apps that allow it. The fingerprint reader on the back is sweet. I don't know what the first tech guys were complaining about online when Samsung put this on the back next to the camera. It's much easier for me to use my finger on the back than try and curl my thumb back to do it on the front like some phones that have the fingerprint reader on the home button. The performance has been amazing in most apps. The camera and integrated scanner - Bixby, is a great addition to explore or to just take some great pics and videos. Battery life is what I would expect from a big phone like this. Lasting me all day with the same kind of use that I would put my previous phones through, emails, FB, and other apps usage. Only thing I really am not a fan of is the headphone jack is on the bottom. But the AKG headset that came with the phone sound great and they work just as great. Fast charging is quick to charge the phone all the way without spending half the day doing it. Overall can't say enough good things about it from the little bit of time I've had it. Keep up the good work Samsung. Thanks"
1660,5,"I just got my Galaxy S7 a month ago and am still impressed with it's performance and looks. The case is the slimmest I've held, and though a bit slick, I haven't managed to drop it yet. The elegance of the silky smooth case gives the S7 a quality feel which IMO offsets the lack of grip, and is negated by addition of a protective case anyway, so the point is moot. Though I do keep it un-cased at home just to enjoy the smooth elegance of the design. It's fast and battery life, while it could be a lot better isn't the worst. The bloatware is a little ridiculous and you'd think there would be better alternatives than voiding the warranty to have fewer resource hogging, worthless apps taking up space and battery life. Carriers, please: as expensive as this phone is, there has to be a way to disable the bloat! The screen is typical Samsung marvelous quality, with sharp detail and crisp colors. The camera takes excellent photos as long as you hold really still. Lots of bells and whistles everywhere! I wish the apps and gallery would really store items on the external memory like I tell them to, but if you crop a photo, onto the phone storage it goes; a habit which can at some point impede performance. overall, these are small nags and even being able to send things to your memory card once again, as opposed to a virtual SD card is HUGE! Thank you for fixing that mistake! Bottom line, this phone does everything I need it to very well, voice is clear, photos are sharp, and the Android OS continues to beat IOS IMO. For a buyer looking for options at less than front row price, this is the phone you need."
1661,5,Definitely the best Samsung flagship to date. Coming from the S6 and its slow speed and horrendous battery life this is just amazing.
1662,5,"so far i am satisfied with my samsung s8, it is completely different from the s6 and s7 it is just gonna take some getting use to"
1663,4,I would tell other people to get it phone but the battery life is not so good. The battery goes out really quick.
1664,5,"I am one of those few that are reluctant to change.. I had an S5 active for a little over 3 yrs i think.... I was quite skeptical about change , having to acclimatize to a new phone etc.. i must tell you.. with the S8 and the smart switch the transition was perfect..i get excited each day i pick up my phone ... I know its a new phone but i still got everything i had before.. just that they work faster and smoother... This is one of those kinds of sweet changes i guess you never regret... All i can say is its perfect so far."
1665,5,This is my first smart phone. The intuitive set-up and design is incredible! I love the easy access swipe feature for frequently used apps and settings. I'm still discovering all the ways that I can customize my phone. I LOVE that I can make it into whatever I want it too be. So cool!
1666,5,Congratulations Samsung for creating a wonderfully designed phone. I am loving the full screen feature. It is also a breeze to navigate through the apps.
1667,5,"OMG, I love the Screen size, and i love how it is curved, the visual effects, and the brightness of this samsung s7 ege is a beautiful thing, i love it and it's a wonderful phone to have."
1668,5,Finally I have a Samsung that has memory to support my needs. I love my S5 but became disenchanted when I kept getting No Memory messages. I do not see this happening with the S8+. The screen is awesome. It is exactly as advertised.
1669,5,This review is very easy and simple. Read the review title and Enjoy Your New Toy.
1670,5,I have bought this phone and have loved every inch of it ever since.
1671,5,I've had the phone 2 days and am impressed by all the capabilities. Wonderful Galaxy S7 Edge.
1672,5,I must say this is one of the best phones that Samsung has made. I really love all the new features that they have put in this phone. The camera is also one of the best ones.
1673,5,"So sleek and easy to navigate. You do not adapt to how this phone works, it adapts to how you use it."
1674,5,"I purchased the Galaxy S8 on the day it came out! The battery life is outstanding and it's well worth the money. camera is awesome and ""smart"" tagging allows me to find things in pictures online immediately! I'm thoroughly impressed with the phones, performance and features."
1675,4,The phone seems good for now only had it a week but if it's like the other samsung products i've purchased in the past then it's good to go. the only phone i buy are samsungs for the 8 yrs.
1676,5,Just got it and the camera is awesome. The many features are a handful but well worth it when I get the hang of it.
1677,5,I truly love the built in home button. Videos are very sharp and hd quality. Web surfing is so blazingly fast and the battery last longer than any other phone.
1678,5,"Even though I have had it for 3 days, the phone is amazing. The screen is superb. Very easy to transfer from other phone. An added bonus is the extra memory space available."
1679,5,I was so disappointed when my Note 7 had to be returned 2 times. I did however faithfully wait for the release of the S8. Many sales people tried to talk me into another manufacturer during the interim release period. I am a Samsung believer and could not be swayed. I love my new phone and am slowly getting familiar with all its possibilities. Will there be a SD card release? I installed a 256 MB card because that was all that is available currently.
1680,4,"This is an amazing phone! It doesn't have all the accidental touches like on the S7 edge. everything from game play to transitions and opening and closing apps is super fast. What impresses me the most is the battery life. I average over 5 hrs of screen on time. the 835 chipset is awesome. IT feels real good in the and and the FPS is way better than on the S7 edge. I didn't give it 5 stars because the Bixby button doesn't always work. Also, How can you brag about Bixby and then release the phone with a half-baked version. I was looking forward to using it. Furthermore, Bixby vision needs to be refined in regards to accuracy. more often than not it gets the picture wrong. Other than that I am extremely pleased with this product so far."
1681,5,"The picture is crisp, it's light weight, the camera is amazing. A little more expensive than i had hoped but a very nice phone"
1682,4,"I just got my S8 plus in Orchid Grey and its such a nice design. I was fortunate enough before it was released to the public to know someone that works for Samsung and I saw it about 1 month ago. Now that I have it, I am enjoying the infinity screen and how things look on there. I am not as big a techie as some others but I am big on sound quality and let me tell you that the sound is great. I can sit somewhere without headphones and be entertained if I wanted. The camera is my favorite and when I say that the pictures are in high HD with professional quality I mean just that. I have not had any issues with the phone recognizing me as I have heard non-android users suggest. I updated from a Notebook 4 and was going to get the 7 but unfortunately had to wait. Well, I am more than happy and can not wait to play around with the Bixby features and various set ups on the phone. I'm excited and did I say its a cute phone. It absolutely is..."
1683,5,"This is what a nect generation phone should look like! Sleek design, fast performance, durable build. A very well rounded device."
1684,5,Like I said its GREAT! But also please don't do what I did and not put a screen protector on this guy just a few days after opening I got some micro scratches all over the screen. Nothing to damaging but very annoying. Thank goodness for Premium plus care! But over all the phone is great it does lag from time to time but if you know your way around android it would be an easy fix.
1685,5,"What can you say, best phone out. Puts iPhone to shame"
1686,5,The product is AWESOME! Completely new awesome experience! New word in the mobile world!
1687,5,"I'm switching from the Note5, so I'm used to a BIG phone. This S8 totally makes it for screen size and features. Have only had a few days, but LOVE it so far."
1688,5,"I have owned Samsung products for awhile now and this is yet to be my favorite product this far. The sleek design is gorgeous to carry around, and the features of the device is top notch. I would highly recommend this device to all of my friends and family."
1689,5,Anxiously awaited the release if this phone and it continues after one week to surprise me. This screen is amazing
1690,4,once u get used to where the new symbol r going from g6 to g8 was pretty ez . had no problems yet and i love the way the screen and displays look
1691,5,Very great features with the camera and selfie camera. Phone has performed great so far.
1692,5,"Very sleek, great camera , love the edge capabilities.. Ringtones r cool, easy to customize."
1693,5,"I am completely satisfied with my new S8, from it's sleek design to it's ease of access, the resolution and clarity from watching movies or taking pictures is outstanding. The options on my new phone seem to have no limit, out of all the phone I have previously owned, the S8 has met and continues to exceed my expectations. I would definitely recommend the S8 to my friends and family. Thank you Samsung."
1694,5,so far i like everything about it. it has a great camera and all features are what i looked for in a phone. definitely recommend it.
1695,5,"I was forced to give up my Note 4 (it died), but the S8+ has not disappointed. I really do miss my stylus, but I'm getting used to it. I love Samsung phones! There is one thing I don't like about this phone though, the speaker is on the bottom instead of the back. When I hold it, my pinkie is always covering it up. When I put it in my pocket or purse holder, I have to make sure I put it up side down or I won't hear it ring. Only a little pain in the hiney though."
1696,5,Awesome clarity! So far love everything about this Samsung phone!
1697,5,Nice phone and the battery life is great! The screen resolution is awesome too.
1698,5,The look and feel is just outstanding. Wish I could have one in every color.
1699,5,"I've had both iPhone 6s and the Galaxy S6 edge. I went from the S6 edge to the iPhone 6s, and now back to the S8+. I missed my S6 edge every day I had my iPhone and the day I was able to go get the S8+ I raced to AT&T and got it. Its ben 3 days and I'm amazed every day with everything I find this phone does that my iPhone couldn't hold a candle to. My S6 edge outperformed my iPhone 6s on every level. The S8+ makes my friends iPhone 7's look foolish. Never leaving Samsung again."
1700,5,"Connection to old blue tooth head phones is poor, I have an older set of wireless head phones that worked great with my old phone, But with this phone the connection is choppy and can't use this head set."
1701,4,"It is a very attractive phone....several people have already commented on its good looks (although I thought my S6 was even prettier). In between the S6 and S8, I had a Windows Phone, which had some superior qualities to the S8 (the camera had 20MP and was better), but I am back to Android for the better apps. I am hoping to master this phone and keep it for four years before the next big upgrade. However, its use is not as intuitive as I would have liked....I am forced to download the manual, to take advantage of all its capabilities. I will write another review when I am better able to utilize it."
1702,5,"This is my first ever Galaxy and so far I'm loving it! this is the perfect phone I was waiting for, thanks Samsung for this oh and a big thanks for keeping the headphone jack!"
1703,5,This phone has everthing I could imagine. All of the features that are important to me as well as a large number that I am discovering. This will serve me well.
1704,5,I just received my new Galaxy S8. So far I am impressed with the image quality and function accessibility.
1705,5,So far it is awesome and would recommend this product to everyone.
1706,3,"Here is my feedback based on my experience with this phone so far: CONS: - Severely overpriced - Different charging tip, therefore no longer able to use micro USB chargers. ALSO, there was no charging adapter, which should've come with the phone, at least the first generation of this change. - No physical HOME button (I loved this feature on the previous Samsung phones) - EDGE screen has limitations with the inability to expand. I regularly used the Quick Menu option on the Note4 (multiple times a day) which had the ability to be modified and expanded. The new EDGE Apps screen has a maximum of 10 apps that can be added - this is unreasonable and inefficient. I'm already having issues multi-tasking with this phone and it's been less one week! - When viewing a contact, must click multiple times to view the contact details. This change was absolutely illogical. - No longer able to get to the phone keypad from the Contacts. - Waterfall edge screen causes issues when handling and typing. The small lip that was on previous phones created a good buffer. I wish I had the option to get a phone without this edge screen. - Bixby was not released yet the phone price remained the same. - Fingerprint scanner is adjacent to the camera lens on the back of the phone, how does this make sense??? The scanner should've been on the front for ease of use without impacting other features and functions. PROS: - Slick design - Beautiful and vibrant screen - Large internal capacity, 64GB - SD card slot - Earphone jack Thank you."
1707,5,"Have only had this phone a day, but it is faster and works so much quicker and better."
1708,5,I love the new features...no buttons everything is touch screen
1709,3,better than s6 edge but should have waited for s8 edge
1710,5,"I've had my S8+ for a week now. It's spelled the end of battery anxiety. I regularly close out the day with 50 or 60% remaining charge which is a huge improvement from my S7. Great screen, good usability. Excellent switching from previous models (I just switched my boss from iPhone and that was also simple). Really it's hard to fault the S8+. It's pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. With a 256GB memory card added in I can have all of my content on board wherever I go. The AKG headphones bundled in also have excellent sound quality. The only thing I'm not mad about are the two different materials on the cable. It's fabric most of the way but old school rubber to the earpieces."
1711,5,love the camera and the face scan. I had the s7 and the s8 is much lighter to me.
1712,5,"I have had the Galaxy S4 Active, S6, and now the S8+! They just keep getting better, faster, and more capable. Far better than anything else out there. I preordered 3 S8s the day that they were first available."
1713,5,"love it, it works well, and Im happy they came out with this phone!"
1714,5,I finally gave in and retired my flip phone for a smart phone. And I made the right choice! This phone exceeds all of expectations and then some. I am still learning all of its features but what I have learned has been easy and straight-forward. I can't wait to learn more.
1715,5,"This new phone has all the features I want plus some. It is sleek, easy to use and has super clear sound. Can't wait to explore all of its capabilities."
1716,5,I love the Samsung's. This S8 is amazing. Would recommend this product to anyone
1717,5,"Sofar, so good, I am on a learning curve, I am getting there."
1718,2,"I have only had the phone for 2 days and am seriously considering returning it. my phones for the last 4 years have been droids and I have been real happy with them. I always seemed to be getting the phones late meaning the next version came out within months of me getting a new phone. I was eligible for a new phone when the 8S came out so I thought I would give it a try. i seem to be having a lot of problem with the touch screen. Having to tap an icon several times to get it to select. the info bar at the top of the screen is the worst. now i installed the update and i keep getting a DQA stopped working notice comming up on the screen. i tried several of the fixes i found on line. the first one i tried seemed to work but then it started again the next morning. now i have tried wiping the cache, the first time no help so tried to wipe it a 2nd time and it seems to have fixed it or at least for the last hour and a half. I have 14 days to return it and if it does not get any better I probably will."
1719,4,I just got the Galaxy 8 and the screen was a little narrower than I expected. The screen is really solid and the phone responses super fast. No waiting for it to think about opening a app. Google maps sees much faster too in locating my position which is a plus on my commute. It is has very little weight to it. The one thing that I don't like right now is that it is very slippery when holding it. There are no corners/edges to get a grip on it. I am hoping after a get a protective case that it will help with this.
1720,5,"This is an awesome phone, this is my second time owning a Samsung Galaxy my previous phone was the galaxy S6. Before that it was an iPhone which I loved till it broke from there I went to the S6 and never looked back, Ive wanted this phone ever since there were rumors about it online. Even after the Note 7 disaster I still had hope and preordered the S8 first chance I got. The design is great, I have no problems with anything, I have not tried out the iris or face recognition yet. The clock on it kinda bugs me as the hours are on top and the minutes are below that and I don't know how to change it, Ive looked everywhere in the settings but it is a minor issue. It either can't be done or Ive missed it someplace."
1721,5,"I really love everything about my new Samsung Galaxy S8+. I even bought a case even before I got it. Really love the features, specially on how it interacts with different things, Bixby, and on how fast the phone is. The camera can easily be used and captures every wonderful moment in just nano seconds! Wow! I also love the infinity display!"
1722,5,Very sleek phone easy to hold on your hand.The screen is beautiful.Just received this phone and I'm super excited to be an owner.
1723,5,"This is a great phone, looks very nice and smooth!!! Would love to get another !!!"
1724,5,"it is the best phone i ever used with great display and best camera , i upgraded from iphone to samsung s8."
1725,4,"bixbi is an terrible ai, if this phone had cortana then it would be perfect other than the price"
1726,5,Extremely upset to find out the charging port has changed on s8 now I have to purchase a new car charger after recently purchasing a new one for my s7. There was no good reason for changing from the micro usb.
1727,5,I love everything about this phone from the camera to the screen. This phone is the best phone out..
1728,5,"I love everything about this phone! It includes everything I didn't know I needed.. which makes it feel so natural to use. The only way it could be faster, would be to read by mind.. Anything speed related with the device seems to be on the network side. The camera is stunning, and pairs well with the beautiful display! The battery life is great (who doesn't want a longer life, though?) I love the battery save options, as well as the RAM cleaner. My ONLY complaint, is Bixby. I understand that there are people who would benefit from its features, but it's just not for me. We need to be able to re-map the Bixby button, or at least be able to disable it from pulling up Bixby, as I accidently launch it MANY times a day."
1729,5,I am very happy with my phone so far and the You tube videos are helpful to learn about the new features
1730,5,"I like the new features and storage. Pictures are crisp, clear with good color. Hoping this one lasts longer than the others."
1731,5,I have only had this product for 3 days now and so far I am in love with it! The screen is amazing. I am so excited to continue exploring all of the new features.
1732,5,The BEST from the BEST! I love this phone! The phones just keep getting better!
1733,5,"The only reason that I listed 4 stars instead of 5 under the performance is that it did a software update two days after I had it. The phone worked perfectly until the update. Since the update, I keep getting that DQA error message even though I've disabled the app. Samsung needs to fix this. I've seen other messages on the internet from other people having the same problem."
