0,5,My daughter really enjoys this galaxy 8 phone and its features.
1,5,"I upgraded from an S5 to the S8 and have loved it from the start. Great screen quality, fast speeds, and awesome camera! Battery life is much better on this phone as well."
2,2,Small size makes texting difficult as the keys are too small. Not have a home button makes it difficult to know which end is up. No noticeable improvement over the S7 and in some ways worse.
3,5,"Love the camera, it takes really clear pictures. Perfect size. Great starter phone for teen"
4,5,This phone does everything and more. The screen size is perfect for my everyday life.
5,5,best android phone out there. the camera and overall quality are great.
6,5,Easy to use and light weight. Screen is perfect and not overbearing.
7,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is an awesome phone. I love it's integration with AI (Bixby).
8,5,The Samsung galaxy S8 I purchased replaces my fourth iPhone. The infinity edge screen is brilliant. Android provide so much more freedom than iOS.
9,5,"The phone is great especially for the money, the camera is decent and the phone is lightening fast."
10,5,I love my new phone samsung makes just the best cellphones
11,5,"I say that it is Excellent because it has every feature you would want in a phone and the sales staff can assist in finding all of the new features as well as transferring data. Unlocked was more costly but with BB discounts it still made it more feasible not to be locked into a contract. The camera is excellent, voice, fingerprint and facial recognition great.."
12,5,The phone is really nice and performs well. Just what I expected.
13,4,"Works great, easy to use. Battery seems to last longer than the S5."
14,5,I recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy 8S. I originally went to the Verizon Store to get assistance with upgrading 2 phones on my plan. I decided to leave Verizon and come to Best Buy to look at some other items because of the wait time and I'm glad I did. The Samsung 8S cost a lot less at Best Buy and the wait time and technician was very helpful with recommending other products and services providing for a better shopping experience with all the savings and discounts I received.
15,4,"Great phone, big screen. Ive had a few problems with it frezzing up on me but i restart it and its fine."
16,5,Very pleased with our purchase! Phone works great!
17,5,"Great all round technology , design , functionality . Good hand feel , manipulation , screen quality . Camera has me using it in situations I previously used hi end SLR . Samsung apps and support top notch ."
18,5,The sraff at best buy had always been helpfull and Knowledgeable
19,5,Works very well. I would definitely recommend the Samsung S8
20,5,The Samsung 8 is the best phone on the market. Forget iPhone.
21,4,"Not a bad phone, definitely need to get a case and screen protection"
22,3,"It's an Android, acts like one, better battery life but still just an Android. Not worth $800 which is why I rated it 3 stars."
23,5,"I was leery of getting an upgrade after hearing lots of things about some of the new phones, but I love my new phone. It’s so easy to navigate and the camera is amazing. The battery lasts so much longer too! It takes my fingerprint unlock easily which was a problem on my old phone."
24,5,Love Samsung glad to have. The battery charges very quickly and last
25,5,This phone is ideal for even the least tech savvy person . It's good for adults and teenager's alike.
26,5,I would recommend this phone to anyone. It's good for teenager's and adults alike.
27,5,"We got this S8 for my wife who was coming from an S6. She had been luke warm about the S6 and never seemed truly happy with it. Since having the S8 for a few months now, she has said she loves it. Excellent battery life was her main like along with a great camera."
28,5,Love this color which is specific to Best Buy! Easy to use phone
29,5,Easy to use phone and great for beginning users...
30,5,Great phone for beginners. Easy to use and a big screen
31,5,"The Samsung S8 is a great phone, easy to use, great features, & competively priced."
32,5,"I purchased this to replace a Galaxy S6 Edge. Very aesthetically pleasing phone. Enter outer shell is made of glass. With that said, within 2 weeks of owning it, I dropped it and the back part of case cracked! Not the fault of the phone. User error. Phone still works. Price at Best Buy better than purchasing directly with Verizon for exact phone. I then sent the S6 Edge back to Verizon for bill credit as part of their ""trade in"" program."
33,5,Holds a charge all day. Easy to use and the right size for a pocket.
34,5,This is very good product and I would like to buy a new one for my family. Thank You Bestbuy.
35,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 exceeds my expectations. Samsung continues a long line of excellance in their android pnone
36,4,Chose the regular S8 because I wanted something to fit my hand better. The smaller size and taller frame (than my previous phone) fits really well.
37,4,Upgraded fro Galaxy 5 to Galaxy 8. Faster with more storage.
38,5,I liked all of the extra features that this phone gives through Samsung. The full edge to edge screen is very handy. The price is pretty hefty but all of the top contenders ran about the same price.
39,5,"Exactly as ordered.................,,,,,,,,......."
40,4,Great phone. Very happy. Tried the Google pixel and didn't like it at all. I'll stay with Samsung products.
41,5,So many features ! Samsung’s technology amazes me everyday.
42,4,I have been using Samsung phones and products for some time now and I am very happy with the phone. They have not let me down yet!
43,5,My wife loves her s8! She hasn't had a new phone in a while so she was a little worried about the upgrade but has lived it since getting it!
44,4,Went from I Phone to this phone. Still gettijng used to it. Battery seems to last about 2 days
45,5,I really like the Galaxy s8. Easy to use and a good size.
46,5,I have been an iPhone user since the 3. My iPhone card reader went out on my 7. They said it would cost $349 to fix. I had the phone for only 14 months. So with the great price on he S8 at Best Buy I made the switch. Best move ever! Wish I had done it sooner. Love it!
47,5,"Great phone, and the features are great, one of the best phones I ever purchased"
48,5,Great phone charges fast keeps a charge for three days!! Great. Camera too
49,5,Awesome phone keeps a charge for 3 days. Has great features. Camera is nice too. The volume on the phone is great too
50,5,The newest in the galaxy collection is the best so far. It is faster and you can see the difference.
51,5,The Galaxy S8 is a nice upgrade from the S& Edge. It takes a little getting use to on its functionality. Caution - get a case! It is all glass and hard to hold onto.
52,5,Excellent phone for the price! Has more memory than the Iphone and you can expand extra with micro sd card.
53,5,Great product. Easy process. The best buy rep made the process simple and enjoyable.
54,5,Very easy transition and user friendly. Colors more vivid and camera takes beautiful pictures.
55,5,Best phones I ever purchase and. The service is very reliable
56,5,S8 is a good upgrade from my previous S5. Screen is excellent. I'm a little concerned about durability. Only time and use will tell.
57,5,This phone is taking some adjusting since i came from an LG phone.
58,5,The best phone I have ever had. Samsung can't be beat.
59,3,"The Phone is awesome! But the phone is locked with Verizon. I wanted to use it with a different carrier but they could not unlock it for me. Both Best Buy and Verizon said they cannot unlock the phone. According to Verizon, they never lock their Galaxy S8 phone! So I was stuck in a limbo. I ended up returning the phone."
60,4,"I like the S8 - except for 2 things. #1 I DO NOT like the fingerprint button on the back next to the camera lens. I have small hands and this feature is not convenient for me. So, I have to use a PIN to unlock. #2 I do not like the small size of the home button and the general ""thinness"" of the clock time. Without my glasses it is difficult to read. I want BOLD."
61,3,"After lusting over the new curved edge phone, I decided it was time to upgrade when my older Samsung device started running out of memory and battery life. Unfortunately, it took less than 24 hours to confirm that I really didn't care for this phone. There are a number of reasons why, but they all seem to be linked to the curved edge glass. Sure, it looks interesting, but it isn't functional. First, it effectively reduces the useable area of the screen. The images do wrap, as does the keypad. But it takes a different finger pressure to press a key along the edge as it does anywhere in the middle. So you needed to press harder to hit the Q, A, Z, P, L and period keys than you do the middle keys. Which is to say, just typing a text or email, one has to use different stroke pressures to type fluently. This variation of required pressure is extended to the phone's built-in functionality. It required a hard press to awaken the phone, but a different pressure to use it once open. This seems to be due to eliminating the bottom button. I like the button, and believe it makes the virtual items of the phone far more valuable with it in place. I can go on, but the message is the same. I chose to return the S8 and get an S7, which I LOVE. I would say that I am a brand loyalist. I have confidently purchase Samsung phones and television for years. Perhaps I am old school, but I hope that Samsung comes out with a different phone in a couple of years when my S7 is getting tired. I will not upgrade to a curved glass model in the future."
62,5,"Love it so far, no problems, works great, cool features."
63,5,Love the phone. phone has great apps and strong wi fi
64,3,"Wish I would have paid the extra $100 or so to get the 8+. While the S8 is a competent phone, I'm afraid that most of the pictures seen in FB are cut off on the sides so I don't see the full image. Also, the screen almost needs to be pushed down to work, not like my old S5 which really was a ""touch-screen"". Don't like the curved edge as it makes it hard to type a zero, etc. Will put up with this for a couple of years and then upgrade to a wider screen."
65,5,Works great took some getting used to after coming different brands
66,5,Amazing speed. It has a great display and the battery life is awesome.
67,5,"I like everything about this phone. It does so much beyond what I have figured out, but it is exciting to explore and learn new things. The only negative is the way you access the phone initially-particularly in low light situations (as compared with the Samsung 5)."
68,5,"I S8 is a great upgrade form the S7 Edge, The phones size feels better in your hand the the S7 edge. Great display, camera. Best Buy always has great deals on Samsungs."
69,5,"Great new camera features, quick and responsive! I would definitely buy this phone again."
70,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a nice upgrade from the S5 that I had. Phone is super easy to handle. I love the size and the design. My favorite is the camera. The least favorite feature is Bixby.... She's and idiot and can never understand me. LOL
71,5,I don't notice much difference from my last Samsung except that everyone tells me how great my photos look. I agree.
72,4,I am enjoying my phone the S6 is a nice phone the camera is amazing that picture is amazing the phone is wonderful that's what I need read out voicemail and all that
73,5,"Love the s7 and there are slight improvements to the s8. Not the largest fan of ""infinity screen"" but love that still has expandable storage, headphone jack, wireless charging, and c type port."
74,5,What can I say? It's a Samsung. High quality as expected. Coral blue is beautiful.
75,5,This phone has plenty of space for all of my apps without slowing it down. It's easy to use and so much faster than my Samsung Galaxy 6! It was easy to set up as well!
76,4,I love the capabilities of the Galaxy S8 as well as the price. Definitely a steal.
77,5,Hıer handy guttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
78,5,Finally had to upgrade and love this phone. Not too much different from my old phone but love all the new features so far. It's also a perfect size for me.
79,5,We have had a Samsung phone for years and we love it.
80,4,So far the phone is pretty cool. The camera on this is excellent.
81,5,It became time to replace my moms S5 so I upgraded her to the S8 and no complaints yet...Samsung could definitely work on their app that switches everything over from one phone to another.
82,4,I am an longtime Samsung Galaxy customer and just upgraded to the S8. So far it seems to be the same great product I am used to. Only complaint is that the screen seems to scratch easier than my previous galaxys did. After 2 weeks I noticed a lot of scratches and decided to buy a screen protector. Besides that I love the camera and am looking foward to seeing the waterproof capabilities in action.
83,5,"The features of the phones these days are pretty standard, but this was the first time I used the HD calling and I love it... calls are so crisp and clear!"
84,5,love the phone except relearning all the different funktions
85,5,I love this phone! The screen is fantastic and it is very fast.
86,4,"The phone is great, has to many apps for me. I don't know how to use all of them. The clerk was very helpful."
87,4,"I'm not sure. It is hard to get used to. I previously had a Galaxy 3 and this phone is totally different. I like some of the improvements but the galaxy 3 was so much easier to use. The message keys are too close and that makes for a lot of mistakes to be corrected. Provide better instructions with the phone to set it up. The guys at the store can do this but when you leave the store, you are on your own."
88,5,Best phone yet . Very powerful. Lots of memory smooth operation.
89,1,"It was horrible to text a message to someone on this phone. The glass plate would not stay in place, and I had a bad experience with it. I'm very unhappy I had to pay for a restocking fee on this phone when it was that bad."
90,5,I had the 5 previously and didn't think it would be a big difference to upgrade. The battery is much better. I can go 2 days without charging it.
91,5,Phone works great. Fast. Battery last a decent time. Pics are great.
92,5,"Great phone. Switched from iPhone to this phone. At first, I only got the phone because it was on sale, and WAY cheaper than the new iPhone, with very comparable capabilities. Love the phone as it is very lightweight, a good size, great video and sound quality. Very happy."
93,4,Battery is better than expected. Many issues with GPS signal dropping and calls dropping. I liked many things about the S5 better but the S8 is a beautiful phone with a much better camera. BIXBY is pretty useless. Cannot disable phone wake from hard press on the front screen home button location - poor oversight. It turns on very easily in your pocket.
94,5,Very easy to operate. I'm still learning all the features of my new phone.
95,4,"The color of the phone I received is charcoal gray, not ""orchid"" gray like the picture. Because my previous phone was an iPhone, I am still in the process of transferring data from the old phone. I DO like the phone. The sound is amazing, the photos are really sharp! The features are easy to use."
96,5,Best size and best features. Camera is super clear. Smart View is something that don't have iphone. The beast!!
97,5,My son loves the ease of use. Great camera and battery life is very good.
98,5,"This product has many great features... I love the camera, the bix by, smart switch, Samsung health and collect, etc.. Basically, I love everything about this product..."
99,5,Great phone big improvement over my Galaxy S6. Another great Samsung product.
100,4,The phone keeps pausing whenever I'm watching TV or listening to the radio.
101,5,This is my third smart phone.samsung just keeps greeting better.fast and problem free.excellent picture quality
102,5,"High quality, TOP camera (my main reason to buy this phone)."
103,5,THIS IS THE 2ND SAMSUNG PHONE I'VE OWNED. IT IS REALLY USER FRIENDLY AND THE PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!!!!!
104,4,Happy with this phone. Much more storage and much faster than the s6.
105,4,Much faster than my last phone....s6. Love all the extra storage. Lots of case options.
106,5,Great quality - performance. Screen/cameras SUPER!
107,5,"Like the phone despite problems with the calendar and Voice to text. Found fixes for both online. Not perfect, but has lots of possibilities, great battery time, and much better than the Galaxy s7. Took a while to get used to the longer phone. Expect learning curve."
108,5,Never had issues with Samsung phones and this one is no exception!
109,5,"Perfect for everything, there isn’t anything I would change regarding my phone."
110,4,"Overall, the phone is good. I like the size and most of the layout. However, there are some aspects I don't like. The edge can be annoying when trying to click on something laying on it. In addition, the phone is very fragile because mostly glass sides......so I'm afraid it will crack on any drop."
111,5,"I have always had Samsung phone but I love this S8. I got the orchid gray, lo e the color and features. Camera is great!"
112,4,Christmas gift to my son after his Samsung S6 broke
113,4,Very fast and no idle item very convincing as a good purchase
114,5,Great phone first time user of a galaxy! Love the picture quality
115,5,I would recommend this phone it works great and it does not take so much space in your pocket
116,2,"The Galaxy S6 edge does not keep a charge, it takes a long time to charge. I've had this phone for a little more than a month and it has frozen up on me twice and it's not that easy to reboot the phone. I have taken my phone off the charge at 100% and laid it down with no usage and the charge dropped to 60% in less than 3 hours. This is the worst Samsung ever. All other Samsungs that I've had have been great. I'm very disappointed with this 1. It was sent to me thru the insurance as a replacement for the S5 I had. Truly a waste."
117,5,I upgraded from the Galaxy S5 and couldn't be more pleased. Excellent screen size and graphics. Tempered glass screen protectors are a little tricky with the curved screen but I bought the Otter Box Commuter case and it's well protected.
118,5,"Bought an unlocked version as it allows me to easily switch between US carriers and International Carriers as I tend to travel internationally quite a bit and switching to local plans is much more easier than being locked in with Verizon, ATT, Sprint or T-Mobile or anyone else."
119,5,I am not a big fan of changing phones but I am very happy with my decision to upgrade with Galaxy 8. Battery life is excellent and I love the large screen. Seems to charge faster than my old phone as well. Easy to operate even for a novice like myself.
120,5,Great phone by Samsung. They make great products in my opinion. It is still going strong today
121,5,I really like this phone. Leaning new things every day.
122,5,I love this phone. Definitely one of my favorite phones in 2017. It is slim and looks wonderful. I was definitely recommend this device to someone that is good for a quality unlocked phone.
123,4,"I would recommend this phone, the camera is great much easier than Apple. Having expandable storage is perfect. Everything about it so far has been great"
124,5,This was a long needed upgrade and I'm totally happy with it! The camera is awesome
125,5,This phone is perfect. Works well does everything I need and more. The camera is very good.
126,5,Love this phone. Easy to use and navigate. Love the photos it takes.
127,5,I bought this for my wife. she really love this cell phone. It's working perfectly as expected.
128,5,I really love the Samsung 8. It has a great camera and I love being able to download free ringtones. Enjoying the change.
129,5,Have been a fan of Samsung Galaxy S series and the S 8 does not disappoint. Great.
130,5,Very comfortable with fun features. Awesome camera and biometric abilities.
131,5,Fun features. Awesome screen. Really comfortable and sleek.
132,5,for my son. he wanted an iPhone but he's very happy with this one
133,5,Had a Galaxy 4 and was worried about s8 being too complicated but it's not
134,5,I moved from a Moto X pure and it is no comparison. Wish i would have made the change long ago.
135,5,It was about time for me to get an upgrade. Everything runs smoothly and quickly; the interface is easy to interact with and the curved edges give it a sophisticated look.
136,5,"This phone is working great for me, and I love the color."
137,5,"Been about a month now, battery life is great phone functions flawlessly disregarding a few hiccups here and there most likely due to the google android software updates which are always fixing one thing like noise issues in camera app to call quality issues in phone app. Make sure you get a case, dropped twice thanks to commuter case there are no damages other then my heart dropping in slow motion . Enjoy a great device at an awesome price compared to Apple's thousand dollar iphone"
138,5,This phone has all the bells and whistles I purchased for my husband he loves it.
139,4,"beautiful and handy device, great camera, and awesome screen colors and resolution, however not so glad with battery life"
140,5,The most user friendly device I ever used and worked with.
141,5,Great phone with outstanding features. I have not had any problems with this phone and I am totally pleased.
142,5,"Excellent phone, this was purchased for my husband and he loves it."
143,5,"Great smartphone over all, great pictures, great cellular reception,great features all around."
144,4,"This is a great phone, I don't like the edge so I turned it off and I find the keypad to be not as forgiving as the iPhone. Other then that this phone is fast and if you can just get by on by on the learning curve from iPhone you'll this one. I do recommend a case and one of those pop sockets because to hold the device because the edge is touchy and will suddenly move you another app if you have big mitts like me."
145,5,"As a former iPhone user, I'm happy to move on to a more mature and sophisticated phone."
146,5,As a former iPhone user...I have zero regrets transitioning to a Samsung. The phone is so much more mature and sophisticated!
147,5,Great phone. Great pictures and easy phone to use.
148,5,"Easily able to use and function right away. Performs well, camera is crystal clear and capture wonderful image. No bitter or crashes. Send txt, share fine and capture very quickly and smooth without any blurs or required lense wiping. Just an amazing experience with this Samsung galaxy 8 than any other Samsung galaxy phone I've ever owned in the past this is tops them all off. This is just extraordinary!!!"
149,5,The Samsung 8 is an absolute great phone. Easy to learn too
150,5,I upgraded my fiance to the S8 from S6....the speed and stability are amazing
151,5,"My wife and I are Samsung people. Phones, t.v., tablets. Went from S6 to this. Very happy so far"
152,5,Great upgrade from my Galaxy 3. Best purchase I could've made.
153,5,"great phone, great buy, just to be honest phone is expensive, i did get a $100 GC per phone so that helped"
154,5,phone is slim and easier to grab. nice screen and great camera
155,4,"It is a very pretty phone, camera is so cool and does all that the android phone is supposed to do , bad side is that it has a lag sometimes battery runs out vety fast ehen used for work pueposes, ai had to lower display brightnes deactivate amoled features, deactivate a whole bunch of services and many other things including usimg battery life saving features creating a lag on the phone to get close to what my old nexus 5 battery life does using all the features. compared to my old nexus 5 it has a lower perfomance and as mentioned battery life :( it is a very pretty phone though... Not bad, not good... it is an android phone.. :/"
156,5,"The Samsung 8 phone is GREAT. Searching online is fast, the camera is superior, there are many extra features."
157,4,"So far I am loving this phone, its crazy fast and the screen as well as camera is top notch. The only down fall with this phone is the battery life is not good but the fast charging helps with that for sure."
158,5,Bought this phone for my 77 year old mother to replace a galaxy s5. It is fairly easy for her to use.
159,5,The S8 is a great phone. The camera takes beautiful pictures and the battery lasts all day.
160,4,"I am not tech adverse by any means but for ""tools"" I often wait for a good reason to change. A recent drone purchase required an updated phone. Of course the update required me to learn a new interface and a few new apps but the thing just works as intended. Even had a great experience with the Verizon agent via chat (or was it a very good AI?!?!)."
161,5,"This phone is a huge upgrade from my S4. It truly feels like a new phone. Sound, picture and camera quality is amazing. Still learning new features every day"
162,5,We purchased 3 Samsung Galaxy S8 phones for the family
163,5,Great phone i ever got. Phone is the best one i ever had.
164,5,Love Verizon Service Great Service from the employees at Best Buy
165,5,Service w Verizon is excellent. Best Buy service great too.
166,4,Phone works just fine. I am happy with the product
167,5,"Great phone, works well, easy to set-up, long battery life."
168,4,Better than my last Samsung. Don't like the wrap around glass. Prefer edges
169,5,Love the new Samsung Galaxy S8 edge! It's a great phone.
170,3,"I tried switching from an iPhone to an android, and this is the device I used. I lasted a week before taking it back. There were some features that I really liked about this phone, but they weren’t enough to outweigh my frustrations. Perhaps if I had started my smart phone journey with a droid I would have loved this phone. And perhaps I was a bit jaded by the horrible screen protector I ended up with, but I have since gone back to an iPhone. Some of the things I liked were that the screen was the whole front of the device. The fact that certain apps came preloaded was actually nice. I also like the functionality of some of the phone’s features as well. However, the screen protector was a piece of junk (as stated in another review). And, I have since realized that the curved screen might not be such a good idea. Yes, it does look cool and allows for additional options. However, it is also harder to protect. Coming from a clumsy person, this is a HUGE deal breaker. I don’t want to live paranoid of dropping my phone and having the screen protector crack, or worse because the protector fell off. Also, coming from an iPhone, the functional differences between the two are bigger than I think they should be. For one, I was almost late getting up for work because my alarm didn’t go off. My iPhone allows alarms to work despite Do Not Disturb being on. Why would I guess I had to change a setting on the droid to allow that? Come on designers! Some cooperation between brands would be nice. Not all of us want to be SO product loyal because we are forced to. I also love the new (Apple) wireless charging capability. I’m a bit annoyed that the technology has been out there for years, but Apple has finally gotten on the bandwagon. There is no reason for exclusivity like that! I’m going to say that I wouldn’t recommend this product because I have gone back to an iPhone. If you are already a droid user, you may love this upgrade."
171,5,"I had a Galaxy s5 so getting the s8 was a huge jump forward. It has beautiful photo quality smooth resolution. It's a very fast phone and I love the storage capacity. Only negative thing is the Bixby button, I keep pressing it on accident and I don't like the headphone jack outlet on the bottom of the phone."
172,5,So far great phone! Meets galaxy expectations. Great camera and loud speaker.
173,5,User friendly phone with sleek design. Easy to navigate.
174,5,would highly recommend. upgraded from Samsung 6 to the 8.
175,5,Loved it so much I got another for my daughter! Very easy to use and learn.
176,5,"Upgraded from a 5 so I was ling overdue Glad to have faster speed, smaller overall device and larger storage"
177,4,Takes some getting used to the curved edges. Also has a feature called Bixby that am still trying to get used to.
178,5,I bought the coral phone for my wife. We trade phones about every two years. So the S6's went away and we go S8's. We are very happy with them.
179,5,I got the coral blue phone. Its amazing. I like it much better than the S6 which I really loved too. I traded in after 2 years and I am very satisfied with it.
180,3,"Samsung Galaxy S8 overall is a good device and I am generally satisfied; however, there are a few annoying functional issues. On the positive side, the screen is a good size with nice graphics; the battery life is good (so far); and the device operates well for the most part. On the negative side, the Bixby feature is horrible (I disabled it) and voice text function is constantly inaccurate or doesn't function properly. TechCoach (VZW App) said that Samsung is working on a fix...so far nothing yet. I'm going to replace it with another keyboard/voice to text application and hope it works better. In addition, the ""pull down"" feature (pulling down the top of screen to reveal notifications, messages, etc.) does not consistently work and takes several times before it engages and you're able to pull down the screen. This may be due to the curvature of the device but it fails constantly. The speaker is on the bottom of the phone (not the lower edge but literally underneath where the charge port is); I find this to be an odd place for it and makes use of the speaker cumbersome and sometimes ineffective or inefficient. I use the hardshell 2 piece beltclip cover/holster and you are unable to charge the phone with both parts together which leaves the screen exposed to be damaged when charging. I used similar cover/holster for my old S5 and I could charge the phone with both pieces together which covered and protected the screen while charging. Overall a good phone but could use improvements."
181,5,Love the security options this phone offers and the long battery life.
182,5,"Love the long battery life, screen size, and security protection options."
183,5,Seems to be a well designed phone. The camera takes phenomenal pix.
184,5,"Good quality ,fast processor,awesome screen,another quality samsung product"
185,5,Good size phone. Volume is excellent. Keyboard is easy to use.
186,5,"I've had apple and galaxy will never own anything other than galaxy!!! The only thing I don't like about the galaxy is the Bixby button can't be changed to another function, still give a 5 star!!"
187,5,Love this phone alot cheaper through best buy then through verizon
188,5,Most amazing phone I have ever used. So many features I don't know where to begin.
189,5,Replaced my iPhone with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and I am so happy I did!
190,5,This phone is much improved over my old Samsung S4. It charges quickly and the sound is exceptional.
191,5,Great phone. Lots of new features over my old HTC. Easy to adapt to. Samsung provides user manual upon request.
192,5,"I was buying "" a first"" smart phone for my wife at Xmas. Setting it up without her knowing and keeping her current phone working took extra help."
193,5,I've had this phone since Christmas and so far it has performed extremely well. Great camera and battery life seems to be very good as well. It charges very fast and I hope it continues to please.
194,5,Upgraded to this from s7. Has alot of nice features. Easier to use.
195,5,I can now send and receive calls. No dropped calls
196,5,I like the phone and how it looks and it works really well
197,5,It has some features I didn't have on my old phone and I really like it
198,4,The phone is easy to use and is the right size. I do miss my note 4. The S8 for some reason doesn't have voice to text feature and I used it a lot. All and all the S8 is a good phone.
199,5,"I purchased two of these phones: one for my husband and one for my son. They are perfect. Both phones were upgraded from Galaxy fives. The newer version offers so many extra features and has a slim, sleek design. Samsung has not disappointed when it comes to the features and ease of use."
200,5,Love this phone ! The picture quality is amazing. My son is really enjoying his new phone
201,4,Our son was in need of a new phone. We choose this phone as he already had a Samsung and had been happy with it. The ordering process was easy and delivery was quick. We were able to set up the new phone easily ourselves at home. I would have given 5 stars if the cost of the phone was less.
202,5,"I've always used androids, so this was pretty easy for me to adapt to. The sales people were able to use a program to switch all the info from my old phone to my new one, which was nice. The first couple days I had it, it used battery power like crazy but I learned a couple tips online about how to put certain apps to 'sleep' and now it's great!"
203,5,Phone works great! Has new features from galaxy 7. Very convenient user friendly phone.
204,4,"Always love new technology and my prior phone was bogged down & laggy. This is my first Galaxy. Love the infinity screen, and the pictures are beautiful and vibrant. The cast function isnt as easy to find & use as it was on my Droid Turbo 2. Havent found anything i hate thus far. Love the ""close all"" function where i can close all apps at once instead of one by one."
205,5,"Great upgrade from my old phone, good deal as well."
206,5,"Samsung does it again. Had a 5, then a 7. The 8 is great."
207,5,Love my new phone. The camera is great. I like the slim design and size fits nicely in my back pocket.
208,5,This is the best phone that I have ever had everyone needs this phone can't wait for the next gen
209,5,I forgot how much I hated Apple until I upgraded to a Samsung.
210,5,No problems with this phone so far. Holds the charge well. Easy transition from an LG phone.
212,4,This was my first purchase at Best buy. Hope every purchases will be worth.
213,4,Upgraded from a Galaxy S5. Of course it's faster and hold battery life longer.
214,5,It's quick and responsive. Trully a beautiful phone and the infinity screen does wonderful. I really like the interface Samsung has laid over the Android UI. It really has some friendly and intuitive features that I think the newer versions of Android could learn and adapt from.
215,5,Upgraded from a s6 and really enjoy the new features.
216,5,Great phone with awesome features for its model . Never disappoint
217,5,Very cool color and awesome phone. It's like having a mini computer in your hand. Great choice for a phone. Samsung has done it again.
218,5,So very pleased with this purchase and Best Buy was so very helpful.
219,4,"Overall the phone is pretty impressive, but the fingerprint scanner doesn't seem to work reliably. Lotta comments about this on the forums. Maybe related to recent software updates? Samsung seems either unconcerned or clueless, but either way it's really annoying."
220,5,"After owning an S3 many years ago, I was hesitant to own another Samsung phone. I'm glad I decided to give this one a shot! By far th3 best phone I've owned"
221,5,Really enjoy my new phone. Easy to use and understand as it gives instructions every step of the way. Good deal with $300 discount.
222,5,This is my first Samsung Galaxy. Compared to the iPhone's it was easier to set up initially. It walks me through everything when first using something new on my phone.
223,5,This is a replacement/upgrade from a Galaxy S5. Couldn't be happier. Still playing with all the features. Will have to report back in a few weeks.
224,5,Great phone and great deal going on. It is working better than I expected
225,4,I really like it it's running all my apps will. Just trying to get used to the screen
226,4,"great camera ,very light to hold, battery is not bad"
227,4,Have had it for 2 weeks now no issues. Still learning the phone.
228,5,This is my 5th phone and this is the best phone for the money (2 for one). I never thought I would buy a phone that does as much as this one does.
229,4,Bought this phone for my son and he seems to really like it
230,4,The camera is awesome. The phone is very fast. Overall great phone.
231,5,Great smartphone with lots of features and like the vivid screen.
232,5,"This is a great phone,I had a Samsung Note 4 that needed to be replaced and wanted a new Samsung S8 and I love all the new features that my Note 4 didn't have."
233,5,I really like this phone. The battery life is great. Vivid screen and excellent camera.
234,5,It was for my wife for her birthday and she loves it
235,4,"Coming from a Galaxy S5 this is like jumping light years ahead. Pros: The screen is nice to look at The phone is fast and responsive. Cons: screen seems thinner and more delicate that the S6, this thing is like a glass sandwich. Iris scanner still a little buggy and not ready for prime-time."
236,2,"I love the phone hardware, especially when compared to my LG G3 (yes, G3) that suddenly bricked itself on Black Friday. But Bixby is the most annoying piece of software I've ever, ever experienced. Now the voice recognition doesn't even work despite my wasting a good 10-15 minutes playing with it. You can't even get rid of it, and the button on the left side is the most likely place for you to press it unintentionally. It makes Clippy look like the best thing ever, and at least you could shut Clippy off!"
237,5,"Migrating from a Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy S8 was much better than expected... improved performance, network and boot up time."
238,5,My kids love there New phone. My daughter uses it a lot for school.
239,5,"This phone makes me glad I switched back to Samsung from iPhone! Easy to use, and Samsung will never make their phones more than the battery can handle!"
240,4,Good phone with great camera quality and fast processing time
241,5,Its only at best buy. What is not to love best color
242,5,The Galaxy 8 is vastly better compared to the Galaxy III. Had recharge the III several times a day and with the * only once a day.
243,5,Wonderful phone... With great camera and amazing design in
244,5,It is a good cellphone. When I beaught it I cannot believe how good cellphone I beaught
245,5,I purchased the phone as a gift for my daughter and she loves it! Its a great upgrade to the phone she had before. We are completely satisfied with our purchase.
246,5,Wonderful phone... Amazing camera and great looks.
247,4,Would not recommend. No improvement over S5. Too sensitive. Automatically changes screens. No one can explain why there are issues
248,5,Got this for the wife for Christmas and she loves her new phone.
249,5,Samsung quality with great new features. Easy to transition from old Note 4.
250,5,"Don't hesitate to get one. I'm very pleased with the phone. I find the battery charge lasts long and very quick to charge. The screen is great, reaction to touch is perfect. Other family members have iPhones, but I'll keep my Samsung!"
251,5,"Great phone, great price point at best buy. Would recommend"
252,4,"I like the aspect ratio of the V30 for heavy usage personally, but the S8 fits in pocket better and has some proccessor improvements. Pics are saturated compared to LG which can be made vivid in post processing if desired."
253,5,This is a great phone I bought it for my wife and she loves it
254,4,It was easy to move through the settings and apps. The gentleman who sold it to me showed me the basics and I went from there
255,4,I've gotten many years of use out of every Samsung Galaxy product I own and I expect the same for this phone. So far I haven't had any issues.
256,5,Bought it recently for my teenager son as a replacement for the iPhone 6s. He loves it so far specifically the customization features.
257,5,I love this phone! The battery life is fantastic and picture quality is awesome.
258,4,i gad to buy this after a update on my s6 that made it boot loop and now wont do anything
259,5,Got this for my sister & she absolutely loves it. Camera is amazing.
260,5,"I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S6 and was having issues with the screen and charging. There was a deal on this phone that I couldn't pass up on. So far I've had this phone for two weeks and Love it! The charge time is amazing as it doesn't take as long to charge. The quality of the camera is outstanding compaired to my last phone. Also, the battery lasts all day long even if I use my phone all day."
261,5,I am very happy with my new S8. It is nice upgrade from the S6.
262,5,Give a review get 25 points. Its great...............
263,5,"It's fast, nice design. Best camera I ever seen. The infinite screen is great to watch movies."
264,4,"I like the size, it's not too big for my hand. It does slide everywhere though."
265,5,"Upgraded from a galaxy s6, great deal and great phone"
266,4,"This phone is great. Would have given 5 stars, but some videos crop on the sides due to the screen format."
267,5,"got this phone on a lease deal so for the price I'm very happy. the camera is the best I've used on an android phone. i like the edge feature to quickly access common contacts and apps. the size is perfect to handle with one hand and fits in the front pocket for a guy. haven't tried Bixby yet and seems unnecessary for Google users except maybe for the ""shopping"" feature on the camera"
268,5,This is my wife's phone and she chose it because it is a little smaller than the S8+.
269,5,"We loved our S 7 but this one is so sharp, love the face recognition feature"
270,4,I took advantage of the Boggo offer over Christmas and that primarily the only reason I switched. I am very used to Apple but Go Google destroyed Siri and is a million times better. Only reason why I didn't give it a five is because it's extremely hard to switch from Apple to Samsung very difficult even for a 30 year old geek.
271,5,"So far so good, like all the features and usability. we'll see in"
272,5,I have gone to this Best Buy location numerous times and have always gotten the best service!
273,5,Made the switch from iPhone to galaxy S8 and have no regrets. Awesome phone.
274,5,Excellent phone easy to use takes good pictures and slim design
275,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 has once again raised the bar for what a smart phone is capable of. No other other phone that I've seen even comes close!
276,4,"I have the Note 8 and love it. I also have this(s8) for a smaller phone thats easier to handle while out adventuring. It too is great, and fits easily in my hand."
277,5,This phone has plenty of memory is fast responding and reasonalblly priced
278,5,The guys at Best Buy are so helpful! They know their stuff too. Collen went to lunch an hour late because he wasn't finished helping me. Then Collen helped me over the phone the next day so that I wouldn't have to drive 86 miles from Susanville to Reno.
279,5,Very satisfied. All the features needed great speed etc.
280,4,I like samsung phones and l am liking even more now. Great phone. I wish it had dual screen function as well just like galaxy note 8 where you can open 2 screens on your phone and work on both of them separately but at the same time simultaneously like on a PC or ipad.
281,5,"I switched from iPhone 6s and couldn't be more happy. The design is beautiful, got used to the finger scanner very fast and like the place they put it in. I can easily set up the phone the way I like. The camera makes beautiful pictures and the battery holds very well. No more looking back, Samsung Galaxy s8 is a great device."
282,5,It was a hard decision to abandon the iphone for the Samsung but I'm not sorry I did it. I appreciate the ease with which I can choose which functions I want and which I don't.
283,5,Finally got my husband to upgrade. He really likes this phone as it is a step up from the s5 he has had for a few years. The Lifeproof case that he has to keep on it is so slim and lightweight. He is glad he finally made the switch.
284,5,I just switched from the iPhone 6s to this Samsung and I love it. It's fast and the battery holds very well. The screen is great and the camera makes beautiful pictures. The apps are badically identical to am iphone so the switch was easy. I'd not go back to the iPhone for sure.
285,5,"It was easy to order, got to my house in 1 day. I was super pleased with th e product and the customer care! Would order any major purchase from them! Plus the phone is perfect. It was exactly what I needed. So simple to use, yet so many amazing applications.."
286,4,I bought the phone as a gift and my son loves it. It's a Samsung...need I say more....it runs circles around any Apple product.
287,5,It works wonderful especially take photo. I compared pictures with iphone8 and results are totally different. It is not clear and vivid.
288,5,I love this phone. I chose this version instead of the Galaxy 8 Note due to the size. I have smaller hands and this one works best. The note is larger than the 8s.
289,5,"Look and feel of the phone is awesome. one of the best camera only Con is placement of the fingerprint scanner , rest everything is nice"
290,2,"I have to touch thing multiple times, I still can't receive texts from iPhones, when typing the last word it type puts itself at the beginning of every sentence!"
291,5,I recently changed to this phone after all the iPhone drama and I have to say that I am happy. Good price and a fun phone.
292,5,"Like the slim look with curved screen. Thumb scan works pretty well, gives option for multiple finger scans so you have option if you have a cut. Quick phone. Battery lasts about 24Hrs with normal usage. Some internet, apps, etc."
294,3,The phone is not a cure for cancer but it's fancier than my old one.
295,1,Thin. Clumsy. Hard to guide. No notificatgion adjustment.
296,5,I love my new S8. I was looking for something that wasn't gigantic that I could use for work. This phone fits the bill perfectly!
297,5,"Upgraded from the S5. Love the phone. Got the black one as a Christmas present for the wife. Got the blue one for myself. I noticed slight differences in the apps that are on the 2 phones. Same phone, same store, ordered on different days, but a few different preinstalled apps than on my phone."
298,5,This phone does it all. It has all the features one needs. It's fast and easy to use with great color OLED screen. Camera takes beautiful pictures. Very satisfied with my purchase at Best Buy.
299,5,"Nice interface, big memory, great camera -- I am glad to use this phone now."
300,2,"I debated between staying with the Galaxy or switching to the iPhone. (The rest of my family has iPhones) This phone is annoying to use. I wish I would have gone with the iPhone The bixyby button is awful, and in the worst place. (being honest I have not set up bixyby). The button is in the natural place to hold the phone. Which means every time you pick it up you hit the button, have to wait for it to load, before you can close it. The curved screen looks cool, but trying to do anything on the curved edge is a pain. From day 1 I had to put the phone on the most strict batter/power saving setting. The phone dies very quickly. I don't use it much during the day. All the default apps that come installed continue to waist space and are dumb."
301,5,Great tv easy to set up and install. good picture and sound.
302,5,"I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note, so I decided to my mom a galaxy. It is easy for her to use and understand."
303,5,I like it better than the edge because it is smaller.
304,5,"I like the phone, I enjoy all the features this phone has"
305,5,It's a great phone. The camera is fun. My only complaint if you want to call it that is about the reminders on my calendar but I'm sure there's a quick fix just haven't found it yet but moving the phone so far!
306,5,"I was looking for a Samsung that was not too bulky, but would house all of the functionality that one would use for both work and pleasure. I found it with this S8 and the color of it appealed to my feminine side. The phone is slim, looks very good, and can be used to conduct my everyday business needs. I am very happy with this purchase."
307,5,Needed to upgrade and the Galaxy S8 was priced right and easy to use.
308,2,Please my bill payment online not sent the payment mail box I paid online or your store
309,5,Great phones I have always liked Samsung phones alway putting some great features.
310,5,I bought these for my teenage kids and these were the biggest hit of the season. They love them.
311,5,She loves the Galaxy Phone. She would recommend to friends.
312,5,"I bought this for my wife for a Christmas present, as an upgrade to her Galaxy S5. I have the S7, and this is another great Samsung phone. This is the 4th Galaxy product that I have owned, and I am hooked. Very easy to use, very dependable, and great quality phones. Not too sure about the Bixby button, but my wife can just ignore that. Keep the great phones coming, Samsung!"
313,5,"I thought my husband was going to have a lot of trouble getting used to this new phone, but it has been a pretty smooth transition."
314,5,"I honestly thought I was going to have trouble getting used to the S8, having previously been used to the S5, but this has been a smooth transition. Very easy to use and customize to fit my needs, and I like that it has a much more spare than previous models."
315,5,I recently purchased a Samsung galaxy s8. It's an amazing phone
316,5,Infinity screen check fast processor check easy on fingers somewhat amazing camera you know it you wont be disappointed.
317,5,I have enjoyed the previous Samsung Galaxy S6 but the S8/S8+ are the best version yet! Very nice!
318,2,"I have had samsung for the past 8 years. This is the worst one yet. Samsung use to have a gorilla screen. I have dropped my phone in the street hundreds of times with no phone case, with no problems. I didnt even drop this samsung 8 and the edge screen is cracked the first 2 months with the otter box on!. Also my phone is not a year old and the power cord keeps saying it is wrong cord and charges very slow. would not recomend this phone. I dont know what happened to samsung between this phone and my last but it has prompted me to not use this for my next phone purchase... counting down the days... unfortunately I have to pay this off first. Hope it will last another year!"
319,1,I have had many samsung phones and have always loved them. This new samsung galaxy s8 is by far the worst phone I have owned since I have been born. The curved glass makes it near impossible to type with bigger fingers. Once you put on a Lifeproof case IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to type. I know samsung doesn't care about the case options but I do because I ruin phones. They counter that by offering the ACTIVE line at a larger cost but then there is no options for a case at all and I do not trust a phone without a case. The Bixby button is the most aggravating button on the phone. They should make a way to delete it from the phone completely. The bluetooth connectivity of the phone is spotty. I have nothing but issues trying to connect to my devices where my s6 had no issues at all. I regret ever purchasing this phone and I warn others to stay away if you live an active lifestyle.
320,5,this is my wife's phone. She had some trying times trying to find stuff on the new phone over our old S4. Got our granddaughter to help out and now she is really enjoying this new phone. She is constantly finding new things her phone can do. She especially likes that voice feature of the phone.
321,5,"took a while to get used to the things that were different from our S4. we actually had to go to Best Buy several times to get someone to show us where and how to do things. But, after playing with it for a few days, we are not enjoying all the updates we are getting over our old phone"
322,4,"Great phone still learning to use it, Has some features my other phone did not have , i am still learning to use."
323,4,This phone is great and takes good quality pictures and the features are amazing!
324,5,"excellent memory, good storage and many other pluses. I upgraded from my S5 and I'm glad I did - Bixbie is a good product to use with this phone - definitely worth trying."
325,1,Do not like edge style screen. Had I known the phone was designed this way I would have gotten anything else.
326,4,"Love processor speed, resolution and everything in general. Headphones pretty nice too"
327,5,"I am really happy with the purchase. i was scared at first because i heard people not receiving update on unlock phones plus the compatibility issues with the carrier but this phone has working amazing in my AT&T line, i really was due for a upgrade"
328,4,So far all good. I have had the phone for 2 weeks no issues.
329,4,this new phone works better then my last phone so I like it
330,3,"The edged screen is a waste and sticks up from most regular cases making it more prone to breaking. There's no IR Blaster. Phone is good. Love sd external storage option! Love the re location of the fingerprint scanner and the different keys for screenshots. I do find the Dex Station a very good improvement and excited to have it for traveling presentations! Otherwise, not a lot of noteworthy upgrades from my S6 really. I just had to have more storage."
331,5,Got same phone for my husband. It's great phone!! I was a great Xmas present!
332,5,Excellent phone and great service. I will always be a Samsung costumer!
333,5,"I am a big fan of Samsung and believe they have great quality products. The picture is awesome and all the features are really cool. It does a lot more than I expected. The speed, picture, and integration with smart-home features makes this the best phone for me."
334,5,"This was a replacement for my daughter's S5 and it's not an exaggeration to say that she LOVES the S8. It is much faster, more storage, clearer details on the screen, and much better camera. I have heard that the screen cracks easier, but so far, no problem."
335,5,I love the phone very much
336,5,"I had to upgrade because the battery on my Samsung Galaxy S7 was shot and wouldn't hold a charge. I've only had the phone for a few weeks, but so far I love it."
337,4,"I was a little afraid to buy a Samsung as I heard a lot of -ve reviews from friends who used Samsung's previous phones, but I am glad I bought this and got rid of my iPhone. So many usable features, amazing camera, amazing display, and so many things worth mentioning. The only slight downside is - it is still not as robust as an iPhone. When I try to copy a lot of pictures from it to my computer, the phone hangs. So, I copy a few at a time. That works perfectly fine for me. I was told that I would like it only for a few months and then will be fed up. It's been 7 months and I am still happy to say to all my Apple fan friends ""You should upgrade to Samsung now""."
338,5,I bought this for my wife a few months ago and she loves it. It has an amazing camera.
339,5,Was a Christmas gift for my 14 year old. He loves is so far.
340,5,This was a major upgrade from my Samsung J3 2016. Not sure if I need all the of the new functions but I appreciate the Google voice commands and much improved camera quality.
341,5,Bought this as a gift and it turned out to be the perfect gift!! The phone is loved by it new owner!!
342,5,Phone for our daughter. She seems to like it very much!
343,5,"Great size, the graphics are amazing and curved edges are helpful as well"
344,5,an amazing device that is very hard to compete with o price vs value. has everything of the iphone x at a fraction of the price
345,5,"Upgraded from an S5 to the S8, what a difference!!"
346,5,"Really good phone, screen is very nice. The phone is really fast. Personally I returned this and got the note 8 for the same price."
347,5,I like this item a lot. Read through the reviews and went with this product from best buy.
348,5,This is a replacement/upgrade to my Samsung S5. So far this phone is much faster and has a greater battery life.
349,5,"would buy again in a minute, love my Christmas present"
350,5,"Love my new toy, having fun picking my accessaries. have always loved Samsung products, needless to say I am a very happy girl"
351,4,"This is a good advanced smartphone. The only thing I don't like is the keyboard, it is very bad with getting correct words."
352,5,Right on par with Pixel and Iphone. Just depends on your taste in OS.
353,5,"Did not plan on buying a new phone but my LG G4 only 2 yrs old, died. Researched Galaxy S8, Pixel 2 and iPhone 7. Based on Best Buy promotions, I went with the Galaxy S8. Sound clarity is very good, good camera, has headphone jack and AKG earbuds are included with the phone. Screen is bright and clear. Battery life is very good which was important to me. Although I've always had Androids, still a bit of a learning curve to learn all of the S8's capabilities. So far, very dependable and I am pleased with my choice. Just hope that it lives longer than my LG G4 did because the price of ALL phones is ridiculous .. IMO."
354,5,This is the best phone I have ever owned. Aside from having to learn the OS upgrades and how they affect the device and/or APS I am really enjoying the faster processor speed. My former phone was a Samsung S4. No comparison.
355,5,"Camera was a gift and a large upgrade from a 6 year old HTC. The end user is not the most gadget savvy person, but the intuitive nature of the S8 makes the transition to the new phone as seamless as one could imagine"
356,3,"Finally upgraded to S8 from my trusty Samsung Note 2. The new S8 drops calls nearly every call lasting over 10 minutes or so. Also it's too sensitive to movement. Hate the constant ""notifications"" pop ups at beginning of phone use. Tried everything to make this feature go away."
357,5,I absolutely love my upgrade from and S6. The durability and quality are incomparable.
358,3,"There is a glitch in the S8 which does not allow it to read text messages via Bluetooth from a car. Some phones work, some do not. I now have to wait for a software update from Samsung. I purchased this phone specifically because it was compatible for my car. How disappointing."
359,5,The screen is very crisp. It takes amazing videos as well.
360,4,"The phone is much less user friendly than my old S3 which I hated giving up, but had no choice as it was finally on it's last legs. I really miss not being able to control the volume of all items at one time by just pressing the volume button on the side of the phone. I find it irritating to have to adjust each separately with a drop down menu. I prefer the smaller S3 as this phone is harder for me to hold and tires my hand out. I do, however, like the quality of the pictures it takes as well as the increased amount of storage."
361,5,The service was great. Helpful & efficient. All options were explained; making the choice easy.
362,5,"Boy, do I like this phone. Last phone was Galaxy 3 and it lasted 6 years! Big reason why I went with this upgrade. Still learning all the bells and whistles, but it's been great so far!"
363,5,my son first phone and he loves it. He keep texting his sister all day lol
364,5,"my daughters first phone and she loves it, she can’t wait to get everybody number"
365,5,"purchased for my wife to replace her iphone 6plus. i was concerned she would miss the iphone, but she loves this new phone. she loves changing ringtones and notification sounds with the zedge app, or taking a screenshot with a wipe of her hand and lets not forget expandable storage."
366,4,I like my Samsung 8. It's a little diffeerent from my 5 but I am getting used to it. My only criticism would be that it comes with a lot of apps that I don't use and doesn't leave a lot of room for the apps I choose.
367,4,"Bought this for my husband as he was using an S4. Great upgrade, still getting used to all the new and upgraded features"
368,4,"Upgraded from my S4. Great phone, still getting used to all the new and upgraded features."
369,5,I purchased this phone for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it!
370,5,Samsung Galaxy 8 is user friendly. The camera is excellent taking beautiful clear and colorful pics. The sound is clear and concise.
371,5,The buying process was easy and safe. I would recommend buying from best buy before going to Carriers Stores.
372,4,Screen slippery hard to hold due to curved edges on phone
373,4,Nice phone but screen is slippery and phone hard to hold
374,5,I have been a Samsung customer for 5 years and have been pleased with selection.
375,5,"So far I'm impressed. The phone is more intuitive like options with a long press on the app icon. Part of my satisfaction is that my previous phone, the Galaxy Note 4 was exhibiting battery/charging issues. The S8 is a smaller form factor with a 21/9 screen ratio versus the 16/9 ratio of the Note 4. I thought it would be a step back not going with the Note 8 or the S8+ but I find my self pleased no the less. It's a powerful state of the art phone but I think there are offering with an even newer version of the android OS. The S8, has Android 7 and some other new phones have Android 8. If I can I will add comments/photos/videos as time permits."
376,5,The time was reached to replace the wifes phone and this phone was the closest in layout and operation as her old phone making the change rather painless.
377,5,"Perfect phone for my needs. No issues with Verizon service, as opposed to the previous carrier I had."
378,5,A great phone which has everything you would need.
379,5,"Great upgrade from the last, no physical home button but I don't miss it. Curve edges make it look very nice"
380,5,S8 is so simple to use and has so many more capabilities! The camera is amazing. Love the split screen multi functionality!
381,5,Nice at this time we will see as time progress in the new year.
382,5,"The offer of $300 off the Samsung Galaxy S8 was a great value and the phone has lived up to the hype. Battery lasts a long time, call quality is excellent, and the camera takes very good pictures. I definitely recommend this phone."
383,5,I got the phone as a Christmas gift for my grandmother. It is a really pretty color compared to the other options. The screen is very vibrant! So far my grandmother hasnt has an issue learning to use it. The only problem is the thing is so freaking slippery! You will definitely need a case.
384,5,android is best. samsung makes it that way! the s8 is better than the s5!
385,4,"One of the best phone ever! The camera is awesome, even the front one."
386,5,Best Samsung phone I've had yet! Takes awesome pictures and has so much storage! Definitely! Satisfied customer!
387,5,This phone is quite fast. The features are amazing. I love the screen and the camera!
388,5,Samsung Galaxy 8 is a great phone. I get great reception and the pictures and videos are awesome.
389,4,"Nice phone. It's plenty fast enough to run most apps. The screen is crystal clear although It's difficult to find a good screen protector to fit the curved edges. It has plenty of space and it's easy to add an additional memory card for additional space. I haven't had to worry about the battery running out yet from a normal day of use, so the battery seems fine for the average user. That being said, if you stream movies and play games all day, you will need to recharge. Sound quality is good. All in all a great phone."
390,5,This is a great product. I would recommend this phone for anyone.
391,5,Best phone I ever owned. Fast. Beautiful display. Great phone signal and clarity. Small issue with an autocorrect that fills faster than I can respond but that is probably an operator issue.
392,5,"high quality, reliable phone, good service with Verizon and Best Buy"
393,5,"I was not disappointed. Great screen display, battery life, and camera."
394,4,Overall would have preferred a flat screen but processor and screen are good. Battery life is decent on this one soon far!
395,5,This phone is awesome! I upgraded from a Motorola Droid 2 and WOW the speed and capabilities (most of which I'm still discovering) GREAT PHONE
396,4,I upgraded to a Samsung galaxy 8 I really like the larger screen and camera
397,5,"Everything a phone should be. Clear images, large storage capacity and long battery life"
398,5,"Took a different sim card than my old phone had, even though I asked your staff if the sim cards were interchangeable and was told they were. But all data transferred and with a new sim card,,,beautiful phone."
399,5,We love this phone & it's so easy to use. Pictures are great.
400,5,Love the bigger screen & how simple it is to use. Great phone!
401,5,love the look and feel of the phone. battery is blah
402,5,"Great phone, love all the features. Samsung is an excellent product and would definitely recommend to anyone."
403,5,The best phone I have ever own super fast and smooth
404,5,soft and flexible making it easy to install / remove. good grip & control of phone.
405,5,I got the Samsung S 8 and I love it. I still have a lot to learn but I'm getting there. It's really a nice phone.
406,5,"Have had a Galaxy 3 and 6, so this was a logical choice. I especially like the ability to add a memory card, which you couldn't do on the s6. Loaded with nice features."
407,5,S8 is a great phone and I love all the features. Makes the things much simpler and easier.
408,5,A awesome phone in samsung family..looks good.easy to figure out features.crystal clear sound when making calls..perfect camera..
409,5,"I was very hesitant at buying this phone since I loooooved iPhones, but y'all let me tell you, BEST DECISION EVER. I got this thru Best Buy with my carrier for $300 off and it was too hard to resist the amazing quality for the price. If you're someone Who's willing to pay a thousand bucks for the iPhone x then be my guest, but for those of y'all who want quality, the s8 is definitely the way to go, it has so many options and it's so visually pleasing; it has yet to disappoint me. This phone is a 10/10 in my eyes."
410,4,"All around I find that this phone is good. However, due to the curved screen finding a good compatible tempered glass screen protector is difficult."
411,5,Everything that I was looking for in a phone is on this.
412,5,"Always a fan of the Galaxy models. Functionality, durability and easy operations along with great advances in common areas as logins and apps makes it the phone choice for me."
413,5,"Great phone, love the extra memory and camera is great also. Wish the Bixby worked better and until it is perfected it would be nice to be able to reprogram that stand alone button on the left instead of simply turning it off. You will not be disappointed with this phone!"
414,5,"Bought this for my wife as a big upgrade from the S3. Phone is very user friendly for someone that normally uses her phone for Facebook, emails and messaging. Camera is awesome and battery lasts all day."
415,5,The screen is very clear and the camera is superb. Lots of features.
416,4,I love the new phone. Great storage. My husband got one too.
417,5,my wife loves this phone and much cheaper at best buy than verizon
418,5,I've had the phone couple weeks and it far exceeds my expectations
419,5,Samsung phones just keep getting better and better. Awesome product.
420,3,Perfectly good phone however the curve screen makes it virtually impossible to find a screen protector that works correctly tried 5 different brands from the cheap to the rediculously expensive none of them are worth a hoot. Hope for the next version of S series phones has a flat screen
421,5,Best screen I've seen yet. Clear sound and very intuitive operations. Great deal at Thanksgiving.
422,5,I love my galaxy 8 so much better then my 5. I should have done it alot sooner.
423,5,The phone is great for pictures and all the apps. Delivery was fast and earlier than promised.
424,5,"great phone if you like samsung....the curved screen in my opinion doesn't really add that much, but the phone itself works great"
425,5,Great deals always at best buy especially on mobile phones!!!!
426,4,This is my 1st non iPhone. It seems great. Will take some getting use to. Plenty of memory. Plenty of features.
427,5,Great upgrade to my Samsung Galaxy S6. Love all the new features.
428,5,I loved all my Galaxy phones! This is just as great!
429,5,"Easy upgrade from S7, improved the functioning of Samsung Pay and use of the Gear S3 I have. Lost Samsung Pay Points when I reinstalled the Pay App but win some, lose some. Glad I got the. S8."
430,5,It is an easy phone to use and I love the fingerprint entrance.
431,5,I am very pleased with this phone. I will always stick with Samsung. Great product!
432,5,THIS PHONE IS THE RIGHT SIZE AND HAS ALL THE FEATURES YOU WILL NEED. I FOUND THE PHONE EASY TO USE AND THE DISPLAY CLEAR AND BRIGHT.
433,5,Bought this for my son to replace his old Galaxy. He absolutely loved his Samsung Galaxy and this is no exception.
434,5,I bought this for my hubby. Very pleased with the large screen and display. Easy to use.
435,5,Love the size and color of phone. It takes great pictures
436,4,Great so far. Good price and very nice customer service.
437,5,My son loved his Christmas gift he really like his phone
438,4,"Love the phone hate Bixby...it is a Siri wanna be, and Google assistant works just fine. And they've dedicated a button to which no one appears to be little figure out from reading on the Internet. How about a 1 button take a picture or bring back the home key"
439,5,"This phone works basically like the S6 I had before, just updated"
440,5,The phone is basically an updated version of what I had before
441,5,"Fast, dependable, long battery life. Good signal and big screen."
442,4,"The Bixby ""feature"" with the side button is in a terrible place, I turned it off. Extremely annoying! And why has samsung moved to non replaceable batteries that is also irritating."
444,5,I love my 8 but i have so much to learn. Im hoping to take a class to clarify some questions.
445,5,"This phone has amazing battery life. You use 3.0 usb and has an adapter for 2.0 usb and micro usb. Has a front and back flash which is absolutely stunning and photos are sharp. This phone has bixby which works to easily make phone calls, open apps and she even raps for you. My galaxy s8 came with a free pair of headphones and the audio quality is amazing. Everything is simple and easy to use. Love it! I even reccomend iphone users to switch to galaxy s8."
446,5,Not a big fan of androids but bought this for my other half and is very happy with it.
447,5,Great phone would recxkment to antone needing skmethj
448,5,A really great phone. Runs smoothly. Is taking time to get used to no physical button.
449,5,Great phone. Couldn't be any happier with my purchase.
450,5,"Overall this phone is very similar to the S7 it is replacing, but it has a much bigger screen and more storage and seems faster."
451,4,This is my 3rd Samsung so I was excited to get it. I actually like the Samsung 6 much better. There are several new features that I don't like and hope to be able to disable or turn off. If someone is fully aware of the changes then buyer beware.
452,5,"It was time for an upgrade, so I went to my go to place to get my new phone. So far, I am very pleased, no complaints with my new Galaxy. Not to mention I got a discount!!"
453,5,Best Buy representative was very helpful... Great product knowledge.
454,5,Best phone I have owned to date. It's fast and easy to use. Amazing camera
455,5,Still learning all the capabilities of the phone. Super fast processor
456,5,"Had S6 which was on its way out so had to upgrade to S8. So far so good Runs much faster, better camera There is a 'back' button that was eliminated but it still appears virually on the screen which I actually like better - other sites found this to be a con"
457,5,This is a awesome phone A lot better then I thought it would be. It dose every thing plus
458,5,I love all the features this phone has to offer. Plus it was on sale with $300 off.
459,4,"I wasn't planning on buying a new phone, but my S5 just up and died on me, so I didn't have much choice. My husband and I have had Samsung phones for years, started with the S3, which I still listen to my ""sleep mix"" on every night. We then upgraded to the S5, and they've been great, until mine died. So, it really was a no brainer to stick with Samsung, and go to the S8. I haven't had much time to play with it yet, but so far I'm very happy. And it certainly didn't hurt that Best Buy had it on sale!"
460,5,"Beautiful camera quality. Fast. Bixby and Google are a great combination. Love the Samsung pay option. Very diverse, easy to change features to your liking."
461,4,Best galaxy so far battery life is great plus phone takes great pictures
462,5,Upgraded from galaxy note 4 to the new s8+. What a difference. Love the cameras on the s8+ and how fast the processor is comparably.
463,5,Has the edge on others cell. Nice and smooth screen. Beautiful display and sound.
464,5,This is a real nice phone I bought it for my wife for Christmas
465,4,No complaints so far with the phone itself. However I would have thought battery life would have been a little better. Also the menus aren't as straight forward as I would like so getting to and changing the settings to make the phone more usable is difficult. In addition there are a ton of apps that Samsung instantly installs on the phone that you have to get rid of so you don't have 5 pages of shortcuts to sort thru.
466,4,"I switched over from my Galaxy S6 to a Galaxy S8. I like that I have twice as much storage in the 64 gig. And I like that you can even upgrade this. I like that it is lighter than my S6 and actually has more viewing space. I'm still getting used to it and trying to figure it out. Tomorrow I am scheduled to take a 1/2 hour class over at my nearby Best Buy when how to best use the phone. I haven't really noticed any difference in the camera clarity. And the volume doesn't seem as loud as my S6. I will ask about this at the class tomorrow. I usually keep my phone for 3 years, but I started having some glitches with my S6, and had to keep deleting stuff because I kept running out of storage space. But I decided to switch now because they had a deal I couldn't refuse. I have the orchid Gray and it's quite pretty."
467,5,Love my new phone! Should have bought one earlier.
468,5,Love the galaxy 8. Won’t go back to an iPhone. Fast and more bang for your dollar.
469,5,"I love, love, love my new Galaxy S8! Samsung phones are just AWESOME. So many features. My first new phone since getting the S6 Edge 2 years ago. Samsung just keeps creating new features."
470,5,My son loves his new phone. He used to have apple. Finally made the switch.
471,5,I am a Samsung fan ... NOW I'm a Samsung/Best Buy fan! First time purchasing at Best Buy ... I'll be back!!!
472,5,I've only had it for 2 weeks but loving every minute of it. Looks great and reacts quickly. Never used Bixby but with the dedicated button I became interested. Works great!!!
473,5,It does what is it meant to do. Good camera and the speed is good as well.
474,5,"This phone is nice and easy to use, it comes preloaded with anything that you're going to need as a light user. I can see this phone lasting a lot longer than any of the other phones I've owned."
475,5,We finally stepped into the 21st century and got smartphones. The S8 is a terrific phone and we enjoying them. Best Buy gave us a great deal. The Verizon store wanted us to drop one of our numbers and the reopen a new number to get the phone deal. Best Buy's deal was almost the same but we did not have to change our phone numbers. Thanks BB!
476,5,This phone is amazing the colors are amazing and vibrant the infinity screen is awesome to view videos it is Slim not big and bulky like most phones the battery life is great it is not get hot at all I love this new phone I give it a thumbs up!
477,4,Great phone easy to use .Finally a smartphone that makes me feel smart!
478,5,In short this review is simple this is simply the best phone I've ever had
479,5,I purchased this phone for my husband. He was an Apple phone user. His upgrade to the Samsung 8 was a huge success. This phone is user friendly. Best Buy was able to transfer contacts and pictures. He was able to easily download his apps. It was a smooth transition from Apple to Samsung and happy he did.
480,4,Was wanting larger internal memory and a better battery. So far so good. It is taking a little to get use to since the last phone was a S4.
481,5,This phone is a huge upgrade from my Samsung note 5 and the service from Best Buy was fantastic. Our sales guy transferred all data from 2 phones to to two Galaxy 8 phones. Way better than going to Verizon.
482,5,"Bought for my son for Christmas. He had a Galaxy 6 edge, loves all the newest features."
483,5,We had looked at unlocked phones for a while.loves
484,5,I just recently upgraded from a galaxy s6 to this s8 and it is amazing. I love the full screen and the camera. Not too much of difference from the 6. I'm glad to have gotten this.
485,4,"She says it's too small, but I think she may be looking at it all wrong..."
486,5,"The best phone ever , My phone was broken and I went to look up for a phone and I came out with this wonderful device"
487,5,Bought this phone to replace my Samsung Notes 5. I like it better than the Notes5. It's a bit smaller and has updated functions and features.
488,5,Smart Switch was seamless to update from my Galaxy
489,5,Samsung is definitely living up to expectations. This phone has super technology and is water resistant/proof as well.
490,5,I love my new phone and the staff were pretty friendly.
491,5,"Just love my new phone.its very nice to look at,easy to use.takes great pics.very clear to see everything."
492,5,"I had a Samsung S6 and checked out the S8 when I was ready to upgrade. I love this phone, and the camera takes great photos. I really like the coral blue color, only available at Bet Buy."
493,5,"I always prefer Samsung over Apple. My new Galaxy S8 undoubtedly excelled all my expectations. Its style, infinity display, camera quality and battery life is absolutely amazing. I am really enjoying my new phone."
494,5,"I bought this phone for my teenage son, and he LOVES it. Built well. Amazing display.. Quick and responsive."
495,5,"I purchased the phone from Best Buy as a gift and received excellent, fast service. My husband loves the phone!"
496,5,S8 hands down the best Samsung phone to date. Leaps and bounds better than the S7.
497,5,Being a Galaxy owner previously I knew I could not go wrong. Held off for several years before making the new phone purchase plunge. Glad I did. Right fit for my needs.
498,5,"I like the new features and the size of this. It was hard deciding between this, and the 8+ for my son. Ultimately we went with this because he wanted something the felt good in his hand."
499,5,"The phone is great and the salesman Bradley was very knowledgeable and great people skills,. The galaxy 8 was a gift for my husband. The phone exceeds his expectations."
500,5,I have always been a Samsung user! I had to switch to an iPhone because it was free and couldn't wait to get back to Samsung! Love this phone!!
501,5,Absolutely love my new phone. Have had it for about 4 months now and have zero complaints.
502,5,Always love galaxy phones. This one did not dissapoint. Love the color!
503,4,"I like Samsung phones and it takes great pix. Phone reception is good, fairly easy to learn."
504,4,Love how comfortable this phone is in my hands. I don't like the location of the fingerprint scanner.
505,5,I love this phone. Great resolution. Its fast and simple interface. The only thing i don't like its the earphones. They don't feel comfortable. They hurt my ears.
506,5,I always check for open box deals and this is one of them! Brand new with all accessories and original packaging.
507,4,I am not a big gamer or internet surfer on my phone. Text - calls - GPS and some music. I use the camera a lot. Very easy to use. Great phone.
508,5,Sales personnel and Geek Squad were rep very helpful.
509,5,I bought this phone and it was all that I wanted and more. I wish there was an option to not get a curved screen. I don't care for the edge screen.
510,4,Chose this phone over all others due to the size not being too different than the s6. Only complaints so far is the curved screen not having an great ways to protect the screen and Bixby is terrible.
511,4,It is a great phone but it is very fragile. Make sure you have a case and screen protector.
512,4,This is a good phone and very much comparable to Iphone X. Considering the cost difference between the two this phone is a real value for money !!!
513,5,I got a great deal with this phone really happy with it
514,3,"The system of navigating through different apps and Outlook became more involved and complex, in my opinion, than the latest update I had on the S5 model."
515,4,My biggest complaint about the phone is the text to speech It will only work when the data is on or wi fi on my old Samsung it would work any time. Because I use this function so much I would have Probly went with a 7 had I known this.
516,5,Phone is very user friendly and gets great reception.
517,4,"Phone looks good and works well. Easy learning curve if your familiar with smart phones. Only negative was that no SIM card was included and no where was it stated that it wasn't included. In fact when we called to ask about a SIM card, we were told it should have been included. Had to stand in a very long line at the Verizon store the day after Christmas in order to get a SIM card"
518,4,This phone has a great processor and great screen resolution.
519,5,Anyone who loves android would love this phone. I’m an iPhone person but my husband loves this phone.
520,5,"I have been a Samsung fan all my life (except for the note7 battery issue). I have TV's, blue rays, etc and have never had issues (outside the note7:) This phone is fast and has an incredible display."
522,5,Samsung has never disappointed me this is like my 4th Samsung galaxy and it keeps getting better and. Better
523,5,The Samsung Galaxies are a great phone to have. I love my S8!
524,5,My wife and I just upgraded out phones and we couldn't be happier
525,5,As someone that has an Ipnone since they came out this was my first travel to the dark side! I found this phone to be easy to use and simple to navigate! I will definitely buy another one when this one gets traded in!
526,5,Phone has very good features and it has very good camera.
527,5,MY SON WAS LONG OVERDUE FOR A NEW PHONE. MORE MEMORY. BETTER SECURITY FEATURES. HE LOVED IT.
528,5,I like that it is blue and shiny and I got a clear case for it so people can see it's blue
529,5,"I don't usually purchase the most popular items, but i backed myself into this Samsung phone and I've been really really pleased with it"
530,5,"Bought this phone for family in Ireland and saved them about $200 by getting it on sale. It was a much better deal than they could get there. Once they got it and plugged in a SIM card from Ireland, it worked perfectly. They needed a simple adaptor for the charger, but everything was easy and worked great. They are very happy with it,"
531,4,"I upgraded my S6 to this phone and am very happy. I had hoped that the battery would last longer than it does, but I love everything else about the phone. I read some criticism about the finger print ID scanner being on the back, but I haven't used it yet. I use the iris scanner for my eyes and it works faster than the finger scanner did. Even in the dark."
532,5,I love this phone and have been vary satisfied with it. It have a great screen and long battery life.
533,5,I love this phone it has all of the requirements i was looking for.
534,5,Best decision I made. I researched alot on the smartphones available and this one is a true winner.
535,5,Better size and brighter screen than my old S6. Camera has better quality pictures and detail. Improved battery life so far.
536,5,Brought this phone for my son and he loves it. States it is better than the droid he was using
537,5,"Wife switched to Galaxy 8, previously had an Apple SE."
538,4,"I bought this phone due to the deal BestBuy had at the time ($300 off). I upgraded from Galaxy S4 (!!). Most data/apps/etc. transferred but not all. Also, some features are different, but that is the price of technology advancing."
539,4,Best present my father got for christmas. He went for s6 to the s8. He love it.
540,4,"The S8 came with necessary adaptors to easily transfer from my previous S6. Plugged the two phones together and everything copied automatically. Also includes a microUSB to Type C adaptor so you can use your old cables to charge. The phone is responsive, excellent screen, upgradeable memory and worthy upgrade from earlier Samsung phones."
541,5,It's Great phone. So glad we upgraded from the S7.
542,5,"I have only had the S8 for a short time, but it is so much nicer than the Droid Turbo it replaced. Fast camera and the images are really nice. Plus got a great deal at Best Buy. WAY LESS than the Verizon store."
543,5,Bought the S8 as a Christmas present for my 17 year old daughter and she loves it.
544,4,"The latest in Samsung's Galaxy S series, it continues to amaze."
545,4,"The phone works fine. The curved screen is nice. I don't like that it uses a different charge cord than the S7. It does come with an adapter for the S7 cord, but you have to have that of you just have the common cord. If you charge wirelessly there is no change to charging."
546,5,Great Christmas deal on this phone. I only purchased it because of the sale.
547,5,"I've been quite happy with the Galaxy S8. I love the large screen, and it has great resolution. This is a great device for watching media. Battery lasts all day!"
548,5,"I prefer Samsung products over the over priced ""fruit"" brand. Good pictures."
549,5,"Expected the changeover on Christmas to take hours and be a big inconvenience. However, a quick call to Verizon (surprise) and the phone had its SIM card in and making calls. Besides some quirks on importing calendars, the only thing missing was the ""smart alarm."" Like the edge display and size."
550,5,The best phone ever!!! Durable and up to speed with all the technological advances. Color is great quality.
551,4,"Christmas present for my daughter...her 1st phone. She really likes it, she's 13. No complaints so far!"
552,5,love samsung products - my whole family has a Galaxy phone love them
553,5,"Once again Samsung slams a home run with this flagship phone. From the super-fast chipset, to the extended battery time, to the fast wireless charging, water and dust proof and stellar Gorilla Glass 3 (almost unbreakable screen) that has a Super OLED Display. Camera picture quality is the best out there and easily out shines my old Apple 7 phone. Even with the low-light shots ! I can't say enough good about this phone."
554,5,"I upgraded from an s5 and I am SO HAPPY I did. The quality of the screen, camera, and fluidity of the system is impeccable."
555,5,"I am not a tech savvy dude. My old smartphone was 4 years old and was taking a few minutes to turn on and I was replacing the battery every 3 months so it was time for a new phone. I was worried that my lack of knowledge and fat fingers were going to be my downfall. I was going for something cheap figuring as that I would drop the new phone into the outhouse or I would just plain lose it. I checked everywhere and then noticed Best Buy had it on sale for 1/2 price, which was about 15.00 a month for 24 months through Verizon. This was 3 days after Black Friday. The S8 is way easy to operate, the battery life is days improved from the last one and it syncs with the Bluetooth in my car immediately. At this point in time I am really happy with it. It claims to be water resistant but I also purchased a water resistance cover for it just in case.The cover makes it sound like I have a cold but I put it on speaker phone and it works great."
556,4,"Love the camera on the phone, super thin - miss some old features the s5 had on it though"
557,2,"Due to raised curved screen, ZAGG cover does not stay on. Phone slid off the couch onto the floor day 1 and ZAGG popped off shattering glass. Screen does not respond to swipe. It takes 5-6 swipes to get response and battery runs down really quickly. One day and battery is dead. I DON'T play games, watch videos etc. I only talk and text so there should be no reason for dead battery. I would not purchase it again."
558,5,"It was time for an upgrade, I purchased it on cyber Monday and saved a bit of cash. no issues with set up, swapped out sim card from old S6 phone and into the new one."
559,4,"Working without any bugs. Great pictures, hooked up quickly to my Wi-Fi. Only complaint is small keyboard and inability to use glass cover."
560,5,We love Samsung products. Bought 3 Note8 and this S8 at the same time for my son. Phones work great. This S8 is just slightly shorter than Note 8 so it was a nice size to put inside the pocket according to my son. We always trust Samsung.
561,5,"Upgraded to the 8S. Looks great, plenty of memory too. Still trying to get used to the screen going to the edges."
562,5,"This phone was for me and I love it.My wife was not impressed with hers.Camera was a huge upgrade from the s5 I had.Professional quality to me and easy to use.the phone has a perfect picture,Has to set phone sound under advanced to get rid of high pitch ,but i was able to change it,so complaints really.Dont worry about the color because I think any case will cover it"
563,4,this phone was for my wife.her view is that its not that much of a upgrade from the s5 she had.The s-beam is no longer a built in feature and everything needs to be set up in one way or another.I call it customizing.The camera is a huge upgrade though.it the best feature considering we have a 1yr old.
564,5,"love the camera, love that is water proof so I didn't have to spend a lot of money on case"
565,5,"Has great features and a slim design, much better than previous one. Also got this one on Thanksgiving Day, what a deal."
566,5,"Has great features and a slim design, much better than previous one."
567,5,"The best phone ever, I can't even.... Image great, Battery life super size the best"
568,5,"Great phone, battery life is amazing, doesn't over heat and the image is crystal crisp"
569,4,Lock button interferes with gaming. Otherwise nice phone.
570,4,Got these to replace S7's. So far they seem to be good.
571,4,Got these during the $300 off promotion to replace our S7's. So far so good.
572,4,I like the feel and slimness of the phone even with a cover (otterbox slim) it still feels sleek.
573,5,"Switched from a Galaxy S5 to this S8. Love it! Very satisfied. It is very slim, elegant ... and slippery. With a glass front AND back, you best get a case!! The included USB type A to C cable supports charging, but not USB3 speeds. BUT the phone does support it. (When plugged into my laptop's USB3 SuperSpeed port, it says ""This device could perform faster if plugged into a USB3 port""). The cable's the problem. A USB3.1 cable should fix this ... also am hoping the wireless charging will work thru a case."
574,5,"I have always loved the Galaxy line with Samsung. However, i left it for a short while when Google phones came out, but then google phones started having odd quircks and i came back to Samsung. Boy was I not dissapointed at all! Also i was able to make the menu look like my google phones so there was nothing to lose."
575,5,Upgraded from an iphone 4S and I absolutely love this phone. The screen and edge is amazing. Coming from Apple it took me a little bit to get used to.. but for me I am much happier with the Samsung. I prefer the Apple Store selection but overall very happy with this purchase. I had Best Buy install a screen protector and upgrade my account and they had me out very quickly. A+ service.
576,5,"I purchased the Samsung Note 8 for a hefty price and I had high expectations for it that I thought it would never be able to live up to. Boy was I wrong! This phone has blown me away and all the anxiety I had paying such a high price seems laughable. This phone is the best phone in the market, in my opinion. Buy without any apprehensions, you will not be disappointed."
577,4,"Wanted an upgrade from the Note 5 and no longer wanted the features of the Note, especially with the unreasonable price so went with the S8. Has been a good phone although have only used it for a month. Does more than I need and came at a good price."
578,5,So far so good with the latest Samsung Galaxy phone.
579,5,I love the face recognition and finger print reader
581,5,Phone does everything you could possibly ask it to do
582,5,Have not updated my cell phone for a while. Brought this unlocked phone on a sale. Really like this phone a lot!!
583,5,Had the phone for 2 weeks and love it. Battery is amazing and all the updates are great.
584,5,I recommend this phone and I can use when I travel too is fabulous
585,5,This phone is the best phone ever! It litetdoes everything
586,5,"We loved our S8+ phones so much that when the Christmas deal for the S8 came up, we jumped at the opportunity for our daughter. Thus far she loves it."
587,1,"I just received the device this week and due to the smooth surfaces, it slipped and fall on floor. I did not realize this earlier, even the back has some glass coating, which cracked. Not sure what's the point of glass on the back. That was not the case with the Samsung S7. Why would you have glass all around. The Speaker is placed at the right hand bottom corner, which is usually where I hold my phone and it gets blocked. I have to keep adjusting my hand and that make it a little difficult to hold it. The earphone is smaller, so unless you hold it correctly I cannot hear the caller at all. Another problem, their Gray looks like Blue. Not sure if it is just how it is. We are checking with Customer Service to see if this the right color though."
588,5,My husband and i seem to gravitate toward samsung products. we were ready for renewal and we had the S5 before with no complaints. I didn't even bother to look at anything else. Love the larger screen. So crisp and clear. and the camera function has almost no delay. Wonderful phone.
589,5,"Been through early iPhones; switched to Samsung Note 3, then Note 4 over the years. (iPhone users dissed me when I had the Note 3 as a ""phablet"" and mocked the size. Funny how iPhones soon followed and now it's norm ;-)) My Note 4 was getting twitchy and although I hated giving up the swappable battery, the S8 is large enough yet smaller than the Note series or the new iPhone + models. The slight reduction in width makes it much easier to get in / out of a pocket. The display is fabulous and you can install a micro SD up to 256. (Compared to iPhone's fixed and very expensive memory.) The battery life has been impressive. One charge has lasted 2 days several times. The Best Buy sale (almost 1/2 price) convinced me. In the end, it cost 1/3 of the new iPhone X. I added a FayTun Glass screen protector and TORRAS Slim Fit Matte Finish case, it's got a great feel while keeping a very slim profile. Very happy with it!"
590,5,Glad to have it. Something I would tell family and friends about.
591,5,"but now I see the need for a phone with all these features. little did I know it was water resistant when I dropped it in a pool I was cleaning...knee jerk reaction to fetch this device took out my Pioneer wireless headphones. Phone is great wet or dry, its a great buy."
592,5,"I had a S5 and transferring the S8 has been very easy. I love the edge to edge design and the clarity of the display. Still working out some minor use issues. You do have to be careful when swiping as apps will open. Overall, very nice."
593,5,"Had an S5 for many years, finally decided to upgrade to S8. Very happy with the extra memory and the overall functionality of the phone. Really enjoying the quality of the camera."
594,5,much faster and easier to use then my s6. My wife likes it and will probably get one too.
595,3,"Great phone, with more features than Iphone. However, transferring all from Iphone to the S8, was impossible. Took it to the Samsung store, but they were not able to help me with it. Unless you are a tech geek, you won't be able to transfer anything but your contacts and calendar."
596,4,"Love the screen on this phone, and it's nice and thin, not to mention water resistant. Although I'm not a fan of the cost of these devices, it's a great product."
597,4,"Works as expected. Long time Samsung Galaxy user/buyer. Not a fan of color choices, would have preferred white, pink, or gold options."
598,4,"Long time Samsung Galaxy user owner. Not a fan of the color, would have preferred white or gold option. Seems to work as expected."
599,5,The phone works as expected. The front facing camera is not my favorite but it gets the job done
600,5,We love it !!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
601,5,I think this is the best phone on the market. Excellent screen and speed.
602,5,"Great phone, has a good battery life and is very fast"
603,5,I bought mine and two days later my wife wanted her upgrade. The apps on the phone really fly and it is easy to configure to your liking.
604,5,the best alternative to an iphone. Pretty much in today's marketplace you are either an android or apple user. this is the phone for android users
605,5,So far I am enjoying this phone....still learning! I replaced a Galaxy 5 and it is working well for me.
606,1,I always love samsung but the thing I didn't like its that they made all the phones edge they break easy it cost more to replace it or fix it then buy a new one deductible its like 250 hope they start making them square or other shapes but not edge not my thing.
607,5,I got this phone on a thanksgiving deal. It’s been brilliant in all aspects and the screen continues to impress me with its features! Definitely a good buy.
608,5,"Quite the upgrade from the S4, no complaints whatsoever"
609,5,"I love the new look of the S8 and the battery life is way better than my S7. Functionality is comparable just in a sleeker design. Camera is better than the S7. The absence of the home and back button really is not a big deal as it's now part of the touchscreen. So far, I'm very happy with it!"
610,5,Love the battery life. Love the new charging port.
611,4,"good phone and good features, infinite display and camera quality's are good.."
612,4,Always had great luck with Samsung products. This is a gift for my son. I expect great things from this product.
613,5,I had used a Samsung S6 phone for 2 years and recently upgraded to Samsung S8 phone. I like the product; has plenty of new features.
614,5,Love my new Galaxy S8. My first smart phone. Learn something new about every day.
615,5,"Great size screen, the time and date display along the edge of screen is an excellent feature."
616,5,Worked really well international and in the us. Camera works great
617,5,"I've always used Samsung products whether phones, appliances or electronics and never had any problems with the brand. I had a Samsung S4 phone before I purchased the S8 and it still works just fine. Got a new phone just because..."
618,5,I am sorry for all of the iPhone users that spend too much on a mediocre product.
619,5,Ease of use after training. Takes great pictures. Fast charging capability.
620,4,"As a longtime Samsung customer, it was an easy choice to upgrade to the S8. The graphics are a step up from my S5 but it is the better battery and bigger storage that really make the difference in my day to day thusfar."
621,5,"Excellent phone, ease of using, the camera is excellent quality."
622,4,I haven't had the phone to long. It seems to be doing good. There is quite a few functions to the S8 that I have yet to learn how to use. Overall I think it is a good phone.
623,5,"Purchasing this phone just solidifies what I knew all along. There is just way too much hype with iPhones. Samsung and Android deliver a 1-2 punch that K.O.'s all the other competition. My S8 is fast, durable, reliable and more than smart, it's downright genius."
624,4,"Great phone, delivery was fine but the curved screen is a nightmare if you like to use screen protectors to safeguard your investment. None of the glass ones work well and they will crack easily on the curve if hit. PET ones fit good but don't offer the protection of tempered glass. Just beware."
625,3,They changed the charger port on this one. My only gripe so far.
626,5,Great functionality especially after leaving iPhone.
627,5,"This phone is all the promotion says it is. It is easy to use, has great camera, and easy to use applications."
628,3,The other things are perfect but my only issue is regarding to the battery performance and it's not as I saw from the reviews and some YouTubes
629,5,Upgraded my wife's phone and she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and customize to her liking.
630,5,Slimmer design and easy to transfer all the data from my old phone. Works wonderful so far!
631,5,"Absolutely love my new phone! The phone is a bit narrower than the 7 Edge (which I prefer), but overall just a great product"
632,5,One of the best phones I have had so far. Camera is not as good as others like pixel
633,5,"Initially I don't like the size of the phone .when I had cover on it,I can feel good in my hands.no lagging,unlock with finger print scanner is not that fast.nice design.if you really looking for a good phone go for it.you have other option too ,wait for a month Samsung may release next version of it's Galaxy series"
634,5,A battery that lasts all day and plenty of storage space. Couldn't ask for more.
635,5,was using an S7 Edge when I decided to upgrade to this phone. The screen is just fantastic and love the camera!
636,5,I found this phone easy to operate and fast to process
637,4,"The phone is wonderful in all aspects of performance that you expect from a flagship phone, but Bixby. Same gripe of dedicated side button that cannot be used for anything but Bixby."
638,4,Good phone. Not sure if there is a voice pickup problem.
639,5,Love the result of the camera. Long lasting battery.
640,5,Love this Samsung galaxy S8 LTE! I have never purchased an unlocked phone before . It was very easy to set up with my provider . I am still learning all the great things I can do with this phone . Very happy with it ..
641,4,"I was debating between a Google Pixel 2 or the Galaxy S8, and I chose the S8 since Best Buy had a great deal on it. I'm not disappointed. I love the camera the most; the pictures are bright and clear and capture my kids' activities very nicely. A couple things I don't care for - the inability to delete all the pre-installed apps and the edge screen is easily triggered accidentally. Other than those minor things, I'm very happy with my purchase."
642,4,Good service on line quick delivery and good product choices. Easy user friendly sight and great price.
644,5,We previous owned a pair of j7's and these phones are a little better. They are fast and have a great screen. I am very pleased with the purchase overall. The only negative I have found is that the speech recognition does not work as well as our J7's or the S5's before them.
645,5,"This cell is faster, the camara is the best.All is working well.I am very happy with it."
646,5,"The best android phone, the great smart phone, best choice"
647,5,It is an excellent phone. It has an amazing resolution and photo and video quality. The size is perfect. I absolutely recommend this product a 100%
648,5,My daughter and I love this phone. The camera is the best one yet.
649,5,I liked the phone very much just loved it its amazing
650,5,Best deal and best phone. This time your price beat Costco price.
651,5,"Great customer service, great products! I've only had for about a month but so far, we are satisfied."
652,5,"I like the features on this phone, still able to use an SD card, even with 64 memory. Nice battery life. Lots of options. I used to be able to carry extra batteries with my old S5 for a quick change out. Hope I don't need that with this quick charge phone."
653,5,"works great, runs great. Awesome camera. slight drawback is the speaker. it only has one at the bottom and it's not the loudest. phone comes with headphones so as long as you remember to carry those around it's all good."
654,3,Great price for the latest top line Samsung phone. Provides good Android functionality with the most commonly used apps. Light and easy to hold. Downsides: battery life is deficient with even moderate use; phone has trouble syncing with fitbit wearable tech - a problem Fitbit tech support has not yet fixed.
655,4,"This phone is a nice phone, but it has a lot of updates that mess with the phone, and shuts down some apps and wi-fi"
656,5,I love this phone. It is fast and very user friendly.
657,4,Much faster then the S6 I had and better graphics as well
658,5,Good phone. Easy to learn and customize. Another great Samsung product.
659,5,"The Galaxy S8 is a great phone with much improved battery life and vastly increased internal memory. It works a lot like other Galaxys. But the speech feature still needs work. 0ne word of advice: do not establish facial recognition as a security measure. It doesn't work in dark conditions and can be a problem at other times. Instead, establish a pin. Verizon put through a software update that rendered the facial recognition unusable and effectively locked me out of my screen. It took hours on the phone to get this fixed. So, best advice is to not do it."
660,5,Great phone at a good price. Very happy with it and functions better than my iphone
661,5,I really like my headphone and it is so good. Nice sound
662,5,Very nice phone. I had the S7 edge and this upgrade is definitely better.
663,5,I replaced a Galaxy 4 with version 8. It was on sale with about half off. The screen is about as large as I can carry in my pocket and the resolution is phenomenal. Speed is much better than the 4. It has many options that let me configure it like I want it. Pictures are amazing.
664,5,"I have the same phone from my employer. I use it with a eauto service app.Had the 6 before this 8.Got use to how everything works. Vary satisfied with this phone.My wife has I7 apple,Hate it compared to galaxy 8."
665,5,This is the third Samsung I've had over the last 5 years. I have had great success with them all and no problems.
666,5,Have just gotten this phone and it was easy to set up. Love it so far.
667,5,I brought this phone for my daughter and she loves it.
668,5,This is my first unlock phone and I love everything about it.
669,5,Love how fast it is and how clear the pics are. Great phone
670,5,"Better camera than previous model, slicker design, water resistant is a good feature."
671,5,Love how fast it is. I also love the camera and how big the screen is
672,5,"Bought it for my wife, she likes it very much. Nice!"
673,5,"purchased from best buy, had the best price,love it"
674,5,"This is the best phone out there right now. The phone is beautiful and fast. It does everything better than the iPhone. Got the unlocked version, no bloatwares, get to add my own apps. No stupid upgrades and than another upgrade to fix an upgrade."
675,5,Great phone but I wish it came with qi wireless charger I had to buy i t separatly. But the phone is great
676,1,"Hate, hate, hate this phone! The keyboard is terrible. The apps don't work as my old 4, they are worse. The curve makes it difficult to use many functions"
677,4,Overall this phone is great. Takes a very good pics
678,5,"Love my phone and so happy I gave in to get a new one. My old Galaxy 4 was giving me so many problems but I was afraid I would have a problem getting use to a new phone and all the new apps. I was wrong, it was so easy to get use to. Pictures are beautiful, love the camera. The saleman was so good and helpful with all my questions which really helped me out."
679,5,Bought this for my bf n he loves it. It’s very sleek. Quality is excellent.
680,5,Wonderful looking device with a great display and good battery life. Easily usable with 1 hand.
681,5,"This phone does everything it's advertised to do, and then some. It takes amazing photos, also, I'm still learning the details it has to offer."
682,5,My Daughter love her new phone!! We always buy our phones at best buy!!!
683,5,"Great phone, light weight, love the curved screen, processor is quick"
684,5,I'm android loyal so this s8 is exactly what I wanted for my phone upgrade.
685,5,"Installation was easy for my son, up and running in 15 minutes"
686,5,"Easy to install, easy to use. Best Buy Verizon rep very knowledgeable and easy to work with"
687,5,Finally upgraded phones and this one was on sale. Fantastic qualities. Great battery life. Great camera. And it's fast!
688,5,One of the best devices . Even better than the iPhone x. Camera is great but is kind of small
689,4,"I decided to upgrade to a Galaxy S8 when it went on sale Black Friday weekend because my S5 battery was going out fast. I love the phone, it has many upgrades over the S5, but I am a little disappointed with battery life. I still can't get though a day without having to put it on a charger. I do use it a lot and have many applications (I use it for work) but I expected longer battery life. Other than that, the phone is really great. Don't buy Apple, get a phone that can have expandable memory (micro SD card) it makes life a lot better. The only other complaint I have with the phone is that Samsung phones no longer have a removable battery, so no hard booting. Am hoping that this doesn't prove to be a problem. It was nice to have that feature (plus the ability to replace the battery if needed) The phone itself is a nice upgrade and feels like it is made of quality materials."
690,5,"There is a learning curve, but it is worth the effort!"
691,5,Got this as my husband's upgrade. He enjoys it. The only complaint I've heard is the swipe texting isn't good.
692,4,I brought a couple of my friends to Best Buy and both of them bought phones one of them bought a Galaxy 8 and the other one got a Galaxy 8 Edge
693,5,"buying experience was easy, delivery sooner that we expected/ Love the phone. There is so much to learn about the phone but instructions are readily available and easy to understand"
694,5,Love the apps and how easy it is to use. Samsung camera and options are also a plus. Great phone overall !
695,4,I like this phone so much I brought a couple of people to Best Buy to purchase one and they're very satisfied customers
696,5,Great phone. No issues. Good battery and best phone I have
697,5,I bought this phone for a family member and it has gotten great review so far
698,5,Where a good quality product and much longer better live than previous versions
699,5,The Samsung 8 is a great phone. Like how the charger can be plugged in either way to the phone.
700,5,Love it it's easy to use and I like the ease of use.
701,5,"S8 is very compatible with my professional and personal needs. Great for relaxtion with variety of options for audio, visual and games."
702,5,"Sleek design, not a heavy phone, always loved Samsung"
703,3,Upgraded due to experiencing problems with current Galaxy phone.
704,5,Great phone for the storage and price. Would definitely recommend.
705,5,Like the finger print and cameras. Great display. Like hidden home screen buttons.
706,5,Love this phone. I upgraded my 6s edge to this. The camera is excellent. Take great vivid photos.
707,3,"were all deal breakers for me. While there's a lot to like about this phone, I couldn't get a screen protector to stay on it. The speed of the phone wasn't much better than my 1.5 year old Moto G4+. Before you shell out big bucks for a high end phone, you should check out what's available in the mid-range. My G4+ has a cleaner Android experience. So I returned the S8 and went back to my Moto G4+ and am glad I did. I couldn't have been happier with the Everett, MA staff for their support during the sale AND in the return process. They were knowledgeable, competent and handled the return without a hassle."
708,5,Not to large and not to small Just a real good phone
709,5,back to android after a brief visit to the iphone world
710,5,I'm a fan of the Samsung products. Beautiful!!!!!!
711,5,Best price for PS 4 Slim. Xmas Gift for grandsons.
712,5,I got for thanks giving. Worth for money. It has more features than iPhone X. User friendly
713,4,Is a great phone and lots of cool features. Nice upgrade and really nice resolution screen
714,5,It is a great purchase. I love how it functions... the best that I've ever purchased
715,4,Great phone. Takes really good pictures and the full screen size is a really nice bonus.
716,5,Bought for my son as a present. His old Samsung was dropped a few times and the screen cracked right away. This one has been dropped but the screen seems more durable.
717,5,"The phone like most Galaxy's have been very well made and each upgrade add's some more features, more internal memory, water resistance, memory card slot, faster processor (the heart of these devices)"
718,5,This phone was worth the money due to its great technology and fair price.
719,5,The phone like most Galaxy's have been very well made and each upgrade add's some more features.
720,5,Traded an S6 in for this. It's been great so far. Fast. Nice screen.
721,5,The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the best cellphone ever!!
722,5,Best Galaxy phone to date. User friendly and very fast.
723,5,Great product that does everything I need it to do
724,5,Satisfied with my new phone customer service was great
725,4,"Phone works. As it should for the money you pay. I prefer a more durable phone, opposed to thin, light, & fragile."
726,4,"So far it has been a great phone. Extensive memory, beautiful pictures, and has high end applications others higher priced phones have. Worth it. Samsung makes an excellent product. Had IPhone, then bought Samsung the past few times."
727,5,This phone is great for beginners and experts. Very user friendly has many options
728,5,Awesome phone. Super fast. Great screen. Good signal strength. Iris scanner and fingerprint scanner work great
729,5,Curved screen is the best feature of this phone. This is the best samsung phone till now.
730,5,Samsung 8 is a winner. Big changes from my Samsung 6. I was a little annoyed that my old chargers would no longer work with the 8 but was told that it is a big improvement when transferring.
731,5,"My last phone was a Galaxy S4 and it has been a great phone. I looked at the S8 because it had all the features I wanted. Edge to Edge Screen, Bixby, Finger Print security and an excellent camera."
732,4,"It is difficult to touch the farthest keys on board, 1,0, q, p. It fits much better in my hand than Samsung S6. Added security is nice."
733,1,Phone became useless after a 2 foot drop do not buy extremely fragile and now getting the run around to get it fixed
734,5,I bought the phone as a gift and my boyfriend loves it.
735,4,Good quality item. Easy to install. Is very durable.
736,4,Like the new Galaxy S8. Has mice features not available on our old S6.
737,5,I finally convinced my mom to upgrade from a Samasung S4 Mini to the Galaxy S8. She actually loves the phone.
738,4,I really like this phone. The camera is awesome and the features are great! The only thing I'm so-so on is how the screen curves and I have a little more trouble texting. But I really enjoy this phone.
739,5,"Samsung has always been on the cutting edge, I love everything about this phone. My overall review about this product, I would give it a 100 plus and 2 thumbs up!!!!!"
740,4,Very nice phone. Nice apps like Samsung pay. Only negatives are the Bixby search engine doesn't match up to Google's and the finger recognition is finicky and unreliable. Otherwise an all around great phone that fits beautifully in the hand.
741,5,Switched back from an iphone to the new samsung. So far so good. Much more solid feel than previous models
742,4,I like how easy it is to use the phone and get to settings.
743,5,"Purchased this item as a gift for a friend. The intuitive screen is very user-friendly. The screen has a very pleasant sensation when touched and responds quickly. Love the phone's sleek, slim design. This is a perfect smart phone."
744,5,Decided to buy the S8 Samsung phone over the larger S8+. Love the size and the edge glass. The S8 fits smoothly in my back pocket without worrying it will fall out.
745,4,This phone is a new phone my wife got to replace her iPhone 5S. The new large screen is great and the design is also. The 'Edge' style makes finding a protective case difficult and the fingerprint sensor on the back is too small and in a weird location (next to camera). My wife also has great difficulty getting the fingerprint to read and the screen is not very responsive to her touch. It took some getting used to on the switch from IOS to Android but she is getting used to it.
746,5,"Takes some getting used to (switched from a different brand), but I do love the sleek design, the features and it's fast processor"
747,5,I have galaxy 6edge and is great and now i have this galaxy S8 excited to use it so far its great size and the color is nice.
748,5,Nice upgrade price . Great display and battery life. Lots of options too
749,5,The Galaxy S8 is an awesome phone for the price. Beautiful screen. Feels good in hand. Good battery life.
750,5,"So far with having this phone, I love it. It has more features than my S6. I love how it looks more clearer and I can do and access so much more."
751,5,"I have been using galaxy phones for a while. S3, S5, S7 edge and now S8. S8 has the best camera i have seen in a while on phones and feels sleeker and easy to use with one hand than s7 edge. Love the end to end screen and expanded internal memory."
752,5,"Even better than the s6. Don't like the first screen with the split digital clock, hopefully will find way to change."
753,5,"Like everything except the front screen, have not figured out how to change on front screen"
754,5,"Pros: Fast processor Customizable menus, icons, ect. Sleek design. Clear call quality. Amazing display. Expandable storage via micro USB. Great camera. Cons: Fingerprint scan placement is awkward. The curved glass makes it difficult to find a screen protector that fits and functions well. Overall, I absolutely love this phone. One of the best phones I have ever owned."
755,5,It's a great phone with excellent screen resolution
756,4,"This is a great phone, I have always been an android user but this new one has so many new features I am still trying to figure them out. Great camera, usability and the fast charge it awesome."
757,3,"We needed a new phone, have the S7, and don't love the narrower size of the S8, or the rounded edges, I feel like the screen is much more vulnerable and don't like that they took away the manual home button! I see Apple did the same, but my fingers are dry and smooth and with a screen protector have trouble with touch screen responsiveness! I like my S7 better, giving this to my daughter, which I might regret if it gets lost, stolen or broken!!!!"
758,4,Phone’s display is outstanding. Performance is very impressive.
759,5,Great Android phone. The speed and screen quality are top notch. I have no issues with this phone.
760,5,"The battery life is so much better than expected, call clarity is wonderful & I have no complaints. We have 4 samsung phones and truly love this model."
761,5,Fast and user friendly. S8 is by far the best phone on the market
762,4,"I know you can download instructional material, but you need basic instructions to be able to activate the needed apps."
763,5,Told of the line phone. Samsung has done it Again.
764,5,It has been a couple of weeks. So far I love the phone and its many uses.
765,5,"Excellent product, great service. Would recommend to a friend"
766,5,"After waiting over 3 months to get my new phone, I was very pleased with this one. It is more than I expected and I'm more than satisfied with my choice."
767,4,Purchased online and picked up in store. Purchased as a gift.
768,5,So far it's been a great phone. Good battery life and fits perfectly in my hand. Also works well with wireless fast charger. Lots of features.
769,4,The Samsung S8 is what you expect from Samsung. The setup was easy and use is very similar to previous Samsung devices. Moving pictures and contact is a breeze with the Smart switch app. The speed and color of the screen is excellent. Maybe a little spendy without a sale. (I got mine with 20 days of Christmas door buster.) Everything has worked well on the Verizon network.
770,4,Very nice phone!!!!! Good deal!!! Would recommend...
771,5,"Haven't used it too much, just got it but I love it so far!"
772,5,"The S8 is great. Camera is fantastic, and the resources from the Samsung+ app are priceless."
773,5,"I have been using Samsung products for years, from MP3 players, tablets, and Galaxy Phones. The fit, form, and function is great. The adaptability, and user experience are also great. I despise having to use a secondary computer software to download or upload things to a phone (iTunes/Apple). Samsung makes this an easy plug and play. The camera is as good as my simple point and click digital, and way better than some others I have used. Excellent phone!!!"
774,5,Came activated and ready to use. Love Samsung and love that it is 64gb
775,5,"I love android phones and this phone is the best one. Great camera and love the screen size. S8 is a must have phone. Fast, sleek and works great."
776,5,"Overall experience was perfect! Fast, professional, courteous service. We always go with Best Buy over the Verizon store for their service!"
777,5,"I went from a Samsung Galaxy S4 to a Samsung Galaxy S8. I thought that there would be some new bells and whistles. Can I say how every wrong I was? This phone is so much better. It has a heavier feel, is so much faster, and has so much memory to do things with. The battery life lasts 3 times longer...and the phone call quality is so much better when the speaker phone is used. The camera is significantly better. Basically, Samsung has really perfected things in this model."
778,3,This work ok but it seems like its not very sturdy. I see it not lasting long.
779,4,Pretty much what I expected. Don't really like the curved screen that much. Seems too slim as well.
780,4,"Swore I'd never buy another Samsung, because my S6 had issues from 6 months on, but this was the best deal out there. Not crazy about the curved screen, as sometimes the pictures, words, run off the side. But after a bit of a learning curve, liking it pretty well. Time will tell, I guess!"
781,5,"This phone is the best I've had so far. I use it for everything, from media to work documents. It's amazing. Only downside is that with so much activity, the battery does drain pretty quickly."
782,5,Love the color. Was only a Best Buy special. Got it on thanksgiving for a great deal.
783,5,Very pleased with battery life and features. Upgraded from S6. I could do without Bixby.
784,5,She loves it because of how good the pictures it takes.
785,5,"Upgrade from Galaxy S5 do too many improvements to list here but, battery, screen, and speed are very much improved as you would expect."
786,4,"I like this phone. Pros- pics are great. free ringtones & apps are great. Overall features are amazing... Cons- Texting is not user friendly as the iphone... Finding how to do the simplest things, like capturing a screen shot, is a huge pain... Use is not intuitive, as an iphone tends to be."
787,5,This was the best price during thanksgiving for an unlocked phone
788,5,"I am a Samsung fan and was looking into trying out the Galaxy S8. So far, I like it a lot."
789,4,"So far this phone is great. No major difference from other Galaxy products. Have had the 2, 4 &6."
790,5,Awesome phone! Easy to use. Takes great pictures! Love the different security features like using your fingerprint.
791,5,Excellent phone. Great features. Smooth design. Great camera.
792,4,"Bought this for my son who loves the capacity, the appearance and the functionality of this phone; he had an LG and was always having battery problems and with this new one, no issues."
793,5,"Let me start off by saying that I am a Samsung person. I have never owned an Apple product. Previously, I had the Galaxy S6. I really liked it, but it was old and starting to slow down. I have been looking at reviews for the S8 for a while. This phone has exceeded my expectations."
794,4,"We purchased this phone because we were changing carriers. Also, the previous phone was starting to have problems. We are very happy with this phone."
795,5,Pick up was hassle free and the phone was ready to go. No issues at all
796,5,"love the phone, nice quality, pictures are good, just hard to find a screen protector that wont come off with the case."
797,5,"Love GS8s for their functions, ease of operations compared to other mobile devices, look & compatibilty. Worthwhile"
798,5,Need a new phone but hate having to spend the money so far this has been worth the purchase.
799,5,I have had the Samsung for years and this follows the pattern. It is fast and intuitive. It is a Verizon and it along with Samsung does contain some bloat but I just hide it and it is all fine.
800,5,My wife loves it I think by far it is the best phone she has ever had.
801,5,"Bought this for my son, he loves it. So far no problems."
802,5,"This was an upgrade from the S4 for me and what an upgrade! The processing speed is incredible, the camara takes crystal clear pictures and the battery life is unbelievable. Bought this on Thanksgiving for 1/2 price, so I got another for my wife who loves it also."
803,5,Very good product. I would purchase again. Camera is outstanding.
804,5,"Super fast, sleek, and no slow down. I installed BK disable and I disable Samsung system upgrade to avoid changing the original system."
805,5,Samsung - Galaxy S8 64GB - Orchid Gray (Verizon) is a Excellent Phone
806,5,I hate shopping so being able to may purchase and verify I was ready to upgrade online made my day!
807,5,"Glad I was able to order online and pick-up in-store. The pick-up process was easy, even for it being black Friday. The phone has been working well, and is easy to use. Not too big or bulky, which is a plus. Features like Bixby were annoying at first, but since you can turn it off so it doesn't activate every time you hit the button on accident, I'm not that concerned about it."
808,5,This is my second Samsung phone. I absolutely love it. The picture quality is great and the charge stays all day...and I'm always on it!
809,5,I always like Samsung galaxy because of the technology is very good
810,5,The s8 blew my mind. This phone is everything that it has been advertised as. Great full screen display and it runs so smoothly. Samsung got it right and boy it's been great so far!
811,4,"Great upgrade, not too big so it still fits in my hand and my purse nicely. Still exploring the features!"
812,5,Only had the phone a few days but it reminds me of the phone I used to have which was a Galaxy s3.I loved my s3 and then it died. I didn't like the s5 or the s7 and I was going to switch to Motorola until the kid at Best Buy told me how Samsung improved their phone. I'm glad I listened.
813,5,"Best phone yet. . Much better than my wifes Iphone. .great battery life, camera, quick processing."
814,5,Not only a great phone but Best Buy was phenomenal in helping me buy it and set it up!
815,5,I purchased this for myself and I am loving it. I am a die hard Galaxy fan.
816,5,"This was a huge upgrade from my galaxy s5. My contacts, photos, etc transferred seamlessly over to the new phone. The screen is beautiful and clear and the battery life is incredible. Only downside is bixby. There is no way to disable her and she likes to pick up on things I'm saying when she Is not needed!"
817,5,Good staff it took a while because I did not know my password but they took there time and got it done
818,5,"This was purchased as a gift for my mom. Her Nexus 5 was an end of life device, she needed to upgrade. She loves the huge , clear display. Having a Galaxy Tab , the functionality is very familiar to her. She's very happy with her early xmas present."
819,3,Not a bad phone. Just not wow'd by it. I prefer my previous HTC over this one.
820,4,"I purchased this phone with great trepidation as my S6 was a horror. Slow,horrible battery life, and over heating. Within 6 months I had to return it under warranty and nurse a new one for a year and a half until the contract was up. So I thought of going to the IPhone but everywhere I went I was told that the S8 had addressed those issues. I finally took the leap of faith and purchased the S8 in September and have not been sorry. Good if not excellent battery life, very few over heating issues, and fast. The fingerprint sensor location is a pain and the Bixby button is an enigma but all that can be worked around. The important thing is that it works well and has restored my faith in Samsung. I just wish someone will come up with a clear, bright screen that can be seen in bright sunlight AND not show so many fingerprints."
821,5,Can't go wrong with the Galaxy S8. Everything about this phone is top notch. Great screen and fast processing.
822,5,This is My first smartphone with all the bells and whistles. Easy to use.
823,5,"Absolutely great, especially the waterproof feature. Fast and reliable compare to other androids I've owned."
824,5,"A bit larger than my S7, wall to wall screen. Bright display. Really like it so far!"
825,5,Love my Samsung. The people I had to help me were very knowledgeable and great to work with.
826,5,No phone better. Got my whole family one. Highly recommend
827,5,Very nice update to previous Galaxy. Slim design and big screen
828,5,I got 2 of these. Easy to use. Great camera. Fast pone
829,5,It's fast excellent camera and sleek phone. Easy to navigate
830,5,Bought this for my wife as an upgrade. Working fine.
831,5,"It’s a very nice phone Fast, looks nice , and easy to use"
832,4,"We significantly enjoy our new phones. The four star rating is because the edge /curve feature has created difficulty with finding a good screen protector. This has been very frustrating, especially considering that feature of the phone adds no value to me. All in all, powerful, fast, and compact smart phone."
833,5,"Great product, battery lasts more than 1 day. Excellent quality."
