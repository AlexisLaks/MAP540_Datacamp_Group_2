3,5,Very durable and phone can last for years with proper care.
4,4,my husband loves his iphone but I think I do prefer an android. nothing wrong with mine I think it is just preference. my husband went from a flip phone to his first smart phone and is very happy with the purchase even tho he doesn't use or need half of the capabilities of the phone.
5,4,"Don't like that there is no headphone jack and that the home button is non clickable but that is personal preference. iPhone is not really doing anything different, but it still works perfectly."

7,5,"Designed is strong, although phone appears thin..."
8,5,"Great camera, great storage, can't go wrong with apple products."

18,5,Great sales and service. Sales person Godfrey who helped me did a great job!

21,5,"I'm very happy with this purchase, and was so worth getting this over the 10 for now"
22,5,This is an excellent phone. I had the 6 plus. Life forced me to get an new one. I’m not sorry I did.

25,5,I love apple products and I just moved up from a iPhone 7 to 8 plus. I love the bigger phone.
26,5,"Great upgrade, cool features, great camera, love Apple products"
27,5,"All the fun of the 7 plus but with a more expensive back panel! Joking aside, the phone is great, screen and speakers are bright and clear and the camera looks amazing! If you’re looking at the reviews it’s because you’re just not sure if you’re ready to upgrade or if it’s worth it...well, you are and it is! Stop reading and order yourself this phone or find a Best Buy and let the crazy fast mobile department work their magic!"
28,5,"All the fun of the 7 plus but with a more expensive back panel! Joking aside, the phone is great, screen and speakers are bright and clear and the camera looks amazing!"

31,5,My wife has been using Android for quite awhile and she finally got tired of some the issues that prevented her from using her phone. She is in love with her iPhone 8. She love the fact how she was able to intergrate all her Google apps.
32,5,Some new features from the iPhone 7 but what I like the most is that it is a faster phone .
33,4,"Overall, the iPhone 8 Plus was a good purchase, but not a great purchase. I noticed that while going online, the phone seemed slow at first until the next update and then it speed up."
34,5,"Finally moved on from my 4s, and I’m loving the size and features of this iPhone 8! The size is perfect for me - and photo quality is great for taking cute shots of the grandkids. It was well worth the cost, which wasn’t too bad - after the $100 off from Verizon, and the Best Buy deal for accessories helped a lot. So glad I made the leap, I’ve been looking for a while, and the sales guy at Best Buy sold me, by answering all my questions patiently, and making great suggestions."
35,5,Great case as always protects phone from accidents
36,4,Works the same but a lot more efficient. I stepped up from a iPhone 6 and it has been good so far. The camera was a definite upgrade and the apps work as they should.
37,5,Photos are bright and clear. There is plenty of storage as well.
38,4,Buy an iPhone X and get the iPhone 8 for free. Simple activation

40,5,This is a great phone and I really like the new camera.

45,5,Best phone and camera features i would recommend this item.
46,5,I am very happy with my new phone.it works great and is very fast and good graphics

52,5,"She was not expecting a new phone and was very, very happy with her gift."
53,5,"The battery life on the iPhone 8 is far superior from previous models. Full charge last almost 2 days even with the use of apps like music, maps, and safari."

55,5,My son loves his new iPhone 8. He is enjoying many of the new features on the phone!
56,5,"Battery life is great. The speed is also good as it does not slow down, it also has a good camera, decided to buy because it has the same A11 chip as the iphone X."
57,5,"We have always had iPhone until the Samsung Note came out. We switched brand because Samsung is always more affordable than iPhone. Anyway, this time we took the plunge & went back to iPhone and we couldn't be happier. The picture quality is superb. The voice clarity is magnificent. And surprisingly it was affordable this time for us through Best Buy. Will not turn our back on iPhone products again!!!!"
58,4,"I love the phone. The only reason I did not give it a five is because, there is not a speaker plug for a external speaker. I know most cars have connections. I still would of like to have been able to hook up a external speakers with a wire."
59,4,I got this because my iPhone 6s Plus has seen better days so I definilty needed an upgrade. It’s not much different form the iPhone 7 except for the glass back and wireless charging.
60,3,I’m happy so far. But I notice my phone freezes a lot. Not sure if it’s the phone itself or the OS.
61,5,Great phone that is user friendly and great screen!
62,5,"I’m furious at Apple for slowing down my iPhone 6 to the point of being unusable with OS11. They forced me to upgrade to the 8, but I must admit it is a very nice product."
63,5,"Love apple, the 8 has a lot of great features worth the upgrade"
64,5,This is my first smart phone and I think I made the right choice. I chose a IPhone because it is set up just like my iPad. Love the size of the iPhone 8. It’s like having a mini iPad. Kenneth at Best Buy was so helpful. I really appreciated his knowledge and patiences.
65,5,Upgraded from a 6. Response time is faster connecting to WiFi is quicker.
66,5,this is a great phone. iPhone is easy to use and syncs up easily with MacBook.

73,5,I had the 6 but really like the screen size and camera on the 8.
74,4,Apple 8 plus although not the X is still a dependable device and made my teenager extremely happy. I feel the product is still a little pricey since its now considered outdated but overall still a good product.
75,3,This phone is almost the same as I phone 6 plus. Except it freezes a lot
76,4,Great phone. Worth getting ar Best Buy. Customer service was great as well.
77,4,Traded in my iPhone 6S for a new 8. Much better battery life. Still getting used to no headphone jack.
78,5,My daughter loves this phone & it’s great pictures!!!
79,5,I love the size & weight of this phone!!! It takes amazing photos.
80,3,It feels more like a S version of the iPhone 7. If your going to get a new phone and spend all the money you might as well get the X
81,5,Best Buy team did a great job setting up our phones
82,5,Although listed as gold it is more between gold and rose gold! Very nice phone and larger than the 8 which is what I wanted.
83,5,Seems to be a vast improvement from my iPhone 6s that was tending to drop calls. Great clarity and camera!
84,5,I love my new phone! I had an iPhone 6 previously and with poor vision was looking forward to a larger screen and larger keyboard! What a difference! Nice having more storage too. Battery life seems to longer as well.
85,5,This is a very nice phone.i can do thing my other phone couldn't do.
86,4,Love my new iPhone 8 Plus. It has a great battery life.
87,5,"Good Phone, My son love it, and is happy that he is back to a IPhone, He can now sync across from his mac and IPhone. Everything is in both places."

89,5,"It was tough, but Finally got the wife to switch to Apple!"
90,5,Meets all my expectations. Big improvement over my previous phone.
91,3,Had several problems with the product. Phone don’t work properly
92,3,"I knew it so it’s my fault but this is just the same iPhone as before. I figured on getting the latest processor and all, but there’s no difference between this, the 7s, or 6s."
93,4,The camera is great! And the visual quality of the screen in general is very nice and clear. The downside keeping it from 5 stars is that it is remarkably heavier than my former iPhone 6 Plus.
94,5,I love my iPhone 8s it came just at the right time when I needed a companion
95,5,"Though sometimes apple is a little behind, love this version! Love the camera"
96,5,I upgraded from a 6s. The 8 has a better camera and faster

101,5,I love the sound and love the camera. It's the best phone I ever had.
102,5,Love the feel of the phone and the grip with out a case. Love the phone the way it performs.
103,5,Looking for a new iPhone 8 Plus in the gold color and was having a hard time finding one. Finally found one in your store. Bought it on the spot. The ring tone seems to be a little louder than on my old iPhone 6S Plus. That really helps.
104,5,"As a avid Apple fan I upgraded my phone to the 8 to take advantages of their new features I didn’t have in my old phone. Live pictures!!! I love it, they are fun to take and edit when you want a completely different look. The phone is faster than my old, holds more memory and still light to carry."
105,5,"Amazing pics, amazing sound quality, just amazing phone overall."
106,4,iPhone 8 the best feature is the battery life it far exceeds past iPhones. It is faster and the best thing is I got this one free when I bought a IPhone X
107,4,Nice phone i brought for someone and I’m buying a second one for my boy for school
108,5,Good phone and does all I need and would recommend to a friend.
109,5,"Outstanding camera, loads of storage and fast. I have a hundred or so apps and are always running fast and efficiently for me. Good support at Best Buy in store and very helpful on telephone"
110,5,So much faster than 6 plus. The camera quality is great
111,5,Not too much different than the iPhone 7 Plus. A few better features.
112,4,Love it. Love it! No problems with activation.....
113,5,"Just a great product, the phone and it’s new updates are just great!"
114,4,I upgraded from a 6s to an iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 is much faster then the 6.
115,5,Phone is much faster than previous model!. New software that comes with this model seems to react faster and more efficiently.
116,5,This phone has everything that I need. I’ve had no problems so far.
117,5,Love my new iPhone 8. The camera takes amazing photos and it is so much faster than the 6
118,4,I've been an iPhone user for years now. While I can't imagine changing to any other brand I have to admit that the iPhone 8 isnt quite as different as I though it would be. I have noticed however the battery life is a lot longer and the camera is much better than my last one. Overall I am still quite satisfied.
119,4,"Like any other Apple upgrade, this one has few updates and works just fine!"
120,5,I love my new phone! It is a great upgrade from my 6S. I love that Best Buy offers protection & I was able to pay off my old phone using my Best Buy card and earning rewards!
121,5,Great camera on the I phone 8+I am very satisfied with the Iphone.Previously I had a 5s ——no comparison!
122,5,I bought my phone just before my trip to Israel and SO glad I did...the pictures turned out amazing
123,4,Does exactly what is advertised. May be about $100 more what it is sold at
124,5,The eight has a longer battery life and therefore much better
125,5,Awesome like Apple products. Won’t be disappointed!!
126,4,I mean it’s a great phone but I kind of regret not just going for the X getting the 8 Plus was a step backwards
127,5,Upgraded my iPhone 6 to the 8. Was not ready to give up the home button just yet. Just like all apple products easy to use and navigate.
128,4,Quality of camera was not as good as I expected but still a decent phone
129,3,Phone is beautiful and it takes great pictures but I find the phone to freeze a lot and find that my 6s functioned a lot better and a lot faster.
130,5,I have had my iPhone 8 Plus for about a month now and I’m very pleased with it. I went to Best Buy thinking I was going to purchase just the 8 but I’m so glad my significant other talked me into the plus! I really enjoy the upgraded camera and the 256 gigs of storage is outta sight! I went from a 16 gig iPhone 6 to this so I am beyond thrilled with this phone! The customer service was also STELLAR!
131,5,good size - not too big not too small - better camera
132,4,So far I love my i8 phone. Maybe it could be a 5 star rating but I haven’t had it long enough to use/discover all its features. Especially eager to use the camera in various outdoor settings and places.
133,5,The phone is awesome with big screen and super fast!
134,5,I needed a new cell phone and this was a great choice.
135,5,My iPhone 7 broke and I needed a phone. I graded to 8. So glad I did.
136,5,I upgraded from a IPhone 6S. Larger screen is great. A few more features.
137,5,Purchased this for my husband to replace his galaxy. After a short learning curve he loves it.
138,5,Bought this phone for my sister and it works great as with any apple product. Being a little more tech savvy I prefer the iPhone X.
139,5,I didn't exactly plan on upgrading to the iPhone 8+ but love it. The guys at BB were so fast and efficient. Thanks!
140,5,Big screen easy to see got 256 Greg lots of storage and I need that with 20000 plus photos love my new 8 Plus
141,5,"I upgraded from my 6s plus, due to a cracked screen, and other damage, and I am glad that I did. The phone is a lot faster (also due to upgrade in storage space), the photos are better, and the sound is very good. I would recommend this phone."
142,5,I love my new phone! I upgraded from an iPhone 5s and do not regret it!!
143,5,BY far the best I phone I ever owed. and Excellent service at Best Buy
144,5,Purchase this if you want to avoid the fairly new iPhone X and its possible glitches.
145,4,upgraded my daughter's phone and she loves this!!!
146,5,I upgraded a little early because of some problems with my iPhone 6s Plus and I'm so glad I did! It took a while to get used to the home button (it's a little different with this phone) but otherwise I'm incredibly happy with it. Seems a whole lot faster than the 6s.
147,5,I purchased this iPhone for my 10-year-old daughter and she absolutely loves it!
148,4,"The iPhone 8 is similar to the prior generations, but faster and with a better camera. I looked at getting a iPhone X, but liked that the 8 still had a home button and was a little cheaper."
149,5,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas she was so happy and surprised. We love apple
150,5,IPhone 8+ is amazing! I love my new IPhone. Very pretty and a ton of space for music.
151,5,I bought this phone @ best buy on AT&T next for my 22 year old son. We only had to pay taxes that day then make monthly pmts. He loves it. They bought back in his old iPhone 6 for like $180 which in turn paid for his Apple care.
152,5,My wife gave me her iPhone 6s Plus and got the iPhone 8 plus for herself and she has said several times how happy she is with the 8 absolutely no regrets letting me have her 6!!
153,5,Upgraded from 6s+. Like camera. News updates are automatically available.
154,5,I bought this for my son and he has not looked back. Truly impressed with his phone.
155,5,Had the Iphone X but returned it because I loved the home button and fingerprint security. This phone is the 3rd revision of this design and it's safe to say that all the bugs have been worked out so you have a very polished product. Battery life is perfect and the pictures are amazing. Great overall phone.
156,5,"I have always been an iPhone user, but I really like the new features on this phone."
157,5,"So far, my phone is working great. Hopefully I can keep it for awhile without buying a new one."
158,5,No problem moving my old files to new phone. Love apple products.
159,5,Gave this phone to my teenager for Christmas. He loves it and easy to set up.
160,5,"The iPhone 8 Plus is a much heavier then the iPhone 7 Plus, but it works well."
161,5,"Same as always. If you’re an Apple fan, great device, expensive, but can’t do without."
162,5,Moved up to the plus this time. Awesome phone. Really good iPhone
163,5,I purchased this iPhone 8plus for my daughter who is in college. She is thrilled with it. Loves the bigger size.
164,5,This phone was for my daughter and she loves it!!!
165,5,"I was worried I would not be able to learn all about this phone, but it was very easy."
166,5,The larger screen of the 8 plus is great for my older eyes. I really love just setting the phone on a Qi wireless charger at night -- the wireless charging works great and is so convenient and easy! The speaker is great if you want to play music on the fly. The only thing that took me some time to get used to was the different feel of the home button compared to my old iPhone 6.
167,5,Apple i-phone's are very fun and very simple to navigate through the device.
168,5,The ‘Home’ button is a much different ‘feel senitivity’ than legacy (MODS 6 & 4S which I had had prior). The waterproof feature is huge for me as I’m frequently in the pool or at the beach.
169,5,"Pictures are clear, and easy to use. Glad I made the upgrade from my iPhone 6."
170,4,Child loves the camera and the features which can be used between iphone users.
171,5,I have owned almost all of the iPhones and this is the best I’ve owned to date
172,5,"This iPhone is an upgrade from a 6 plus. Although It has most of the same features, the camera quality is impressive."
173,5,"The camera is good on this phone, and it works okay with the newer update. My kiddo loves it!"
174,5,I enjoy the screen resolution and like the new update! My kiddos also really like theirs tons!
175,4,What else is there to say? It's a usual upgrade that isn't breaking the mold.
176,5,Apple does it again!! Full screen WOW!! Such great selfies...
177,5,Gave out daughter the new 8 plus for Christmas. Needless to say she is thrilled with the new phone.
178,5,The iPhone 8 is super fast and works seamlessly! It’s very thin but is a great size even for small hands.
179,5,"I bought 2 of these for my daughters for Christmas. Got a $300 rebate for the old phones. Great product, Best Buy was good to work with in getting them set up, but Sprint customer service is just flat out terrible. Once my contract is up, I will be switching to another company."
180,5,I picked up new phone at best buy. Got better promotional deal than AT&T was offering.
181,5,It's another great product from Apple. No complaints yet and none expected. Also let me just say the Keith at the Greenwood Indiana store made this purchase an extreme pleasure. I will get my new phones from Best Buy from now on
182,5,Anther in a long line of nice phones from Apple as expected
183,5,It is addicting to use. this might take me months to figure out all the different uses.
184,5,Is not much of an upgrade from the iPhone 6 the only upgrade is the camera
185,4,I do appreciate the upgrades from the IPhone 6. The phone is very quick and responsive. Meets my daily needs easily and sinks well with my watch.
186,5,"I love the rose gold color on the iphone and the pictures it takes is amazing. You can take professional looking pictures with a phone. I upgraded from a 6 to 8plus, big difference, everything is so much better"
187,4,"Shop around for the best deal. Love the iphone and always love the service at Best Buy, but not a good deal this time."
188,5,I went from the 5S to the 8 and I love it! I am still surprised of how clear the calls are and I really love the wireless charging
189,5,I pick this up for my daughter as part of the AT&T buy one get one promotion. The Was perfect as she was due for a new phone
190,5,"Love upgrading at Best Buy, customer service is awesome!!"
191,5,Great iPhone faster and reliable . Battery life excellent
192,5,I love the camera features and the fact that the 7plus is similar I went with the 8plus and I’m glad I did.
193,5,But what do you expect from apple? Very attractive!
194,5,Great customer service when purchasing the phone. The phone is excellent.
195,5,Purchased for girlfriend. A very cool phone. She likes it.
196,4,I bought this for my son and he loves it. I am an Android guy but this is a nice phone.
197,5,I like the phone but it’s to expensive to buy for a teenager let them take the used and we upgrade as adults!
198,5,This is basically the same phone as IPhone 7 Plus. A little faster processor and a little better camera but that’s it.
199,5,Went from a 6 plus to a 8 plus! Love the pictures!! Happy with my decision
200,4,My daughter was so excited to get this phone. She says the camera takes great pictures.
201,5,This new 8 plus iphone is awesome. I love the big screen and the updated camera
202,5,I have only had my iphone 8 plus for a few weeks but I am in love with the large screen and awesome camera. I have no complaints.
203,5,It’s an iPhone. Display is exceptional especially on the plus. New camera and lighting are worth the upgrade
204,5,Love the huge screen and amazing cameras. Touch screen is awesomely responsive
205,5,the right size and dose all that I want it to. It takes great photos/
206,5,"The iPhone 8 Plus is a great phone, fast, water resistant, and easy to use. I recommend it highly."
207,5,I almost went with the 7 but I'm glad I decided on the 8. This iphone doesn't disappoint.
208,5,"Great I phone, takes great pictures. Daughter loves it and is glad she went back to I phone."
209,5,Got it for my oldest kid as a gift it went over well
210,4,I upgraded to the new iPhone 8 and love it so far.
211,5,IPhone 8 has fast processor and fun to have. I think this is a better deal than the X. If you don’t need the features in X. It’s $300 less than the X with enough features that you may not need in X. It’s not much of an upgrade from iPhone 7. But huge jump if you have iPhone 5
212,5,The I phone 8 is a pleasure to use. The camera takes beautiful pictures.
213,5,"Phone is excellent, camera is first rate. Easy to use and a good size."
214,5,"Since Apple decided to bypass the regular ""s"" models of their phones in favor of a new number, the iPhone 8 is basically what the iPhone 7s would have been. An upgrade to the hardware, but the same external size and components. Either way, the iPhone 8 is a great phone and is faster than the 7 and boasts a better battery life than its predecessor as well."
215,5,This phone is awesome the screen size is perfect battery life seems good
216,4,I can’t say I’m impressed by this. People rave about the camera but I feel like my iPhone 6 did a better job
217,5,My whole family has only used iPhones since they started coming out. Wouldn’t use anything else
218,5,"Since Apple decided to bypass the regular ""s"" models of their phones in favor of a new number, the iPhone 8 Plus is basically what the iPhone 7s Plus would have been. An upgrade to the hardware, but the same external size and components. Either way, the iPhone 8 Plus is a great phone and is faster than the 7 Plus and boasts the best battery of the iPhone lineup!"
219,4,If you really can’t get past the X not having a home button the 8 builds on the current design of the iPhone that has been around since the 6 was released. Wireless charging is finally here for the iPhone.
220,5,"Phone battery life is amazing, last two plus days and is good for how much I use my phone. Good phone for the price."
221,5,I had a lot of problems and this was a God send and all my problems were solved.
222,5,"So far, I love the new iPhone. It's faster, has a better camera and is still as easy to use as past models."
223,5,Big upgrade from my iPhone 6. The added memory helps on downloaded mudic
224,5,Went with the I Phone 8 instead of the 10 because that's what my daughter wanted. She loves it!
225,5,"I replaced my iPhone 6s Plus with an iPhone 8 Plus. The battery in my 6s Plus was deteriorating & rather than replace the battery I decided to upgrade to an 8 Plus. The battery lasts much longer & I really like the processor speed & the wireless charger capability. Also, I was able to get a pretty decent trade-in value for my 6s Plus."
226,5,Great phone. Perfect size for what I need to do and is great for movies. Camera is amazing
227,5,Bought the 8 Plus for my teenage son. He loves the larger screen size since he watches some YOU TUBE videos. Highly recommend 8 PLUS
228,5,"Upgraded from iPhone 6. I love the bigger size, better camera and more storage!"
229,5,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she has not put it down since."
230,5,Upgraded from iPhone 6. Wasn’t sure I was going to like the bigger size but now I don’t think I can go back!
231,5,I absolutely love my new 8 Plus. I had a 6 Plus and the camera quit working and decreased speaking quality. iPhone is the Best
232,5,"Staff was very helpful, knowledgeable and made time for me."
233,5,I’ve always had the smaller iPhones but i went with the plus and the Big screen is wonderful and great camera!
234,5,I get this phone for my daughter for Xmas and she’ll loved it. It’s really nice features and she’s really happy.
235,5,Upgrade phone works great for now. Best Buy set up phone with cell carrier .
236,5,The phone has worked great so far. Does everything I need. I use it for work as well. Nice screen size and takes wonderful pictures
237,5,I’ve been wanting to get it but I’m just hesitant to get coz it’s a new model of iPhone. I’m happy with it.
238,3,Had to purchase a new phone after the battery of the 6 stopped holding the charge
239,5,This phone is same as iPhone 6 and 7. Can’t tell the difference unless your really into spec from details.
240,5,"Great phone for me , not as fancy as the 10 but great for my use"
241,4,Same as above. Best Buy employee was extremely helpful and knowledgeable
242,3,"Fast and very durable but 8 iPhone does not have portrait mode, something to think about"
243,3,Pretty much the same thing apple’s had for years. Nothing new or that great.
244,5,Like the new 8. Kinda the same as my 7 but works better.
245,4,"I almost love this phone. It's is extremely responsive, and much faster than the 6s I had. The battery life for me (not a heavy user), is quite nice, lasting at least 36 hours before recharging. My only complaint is that it is wider than I expected, and I can no longer text with one hand, even with the split keyboard."
246,5,"Decided not to wait for battery replacement on my iPhone 6 and just upgrade to the 8. It's basically the same phone with a better camera and force touch, plus all the other new bells and whistles. I debated on getting the X but wasn't that impressed with face id and I'd have missed the home button too much. My first iPhone was the 4 and lasted me until the 6 came out and now I got the 8, which is better longevity than any of the android phones we've had. Battery lasts super long now which is great, camera is nice, the gold is pretty. New (to me) home button takes some getting used to, specifically that touch id so so super fast now that it takes me to my home screen when I really just wanted to quick check my notifications on my lock screen or swipe to take a photo. I need to get used to just picking it up and tilting it instead."
247,5,"this is my first foray into the PLUS size iPhone. at first I thought it would be bulky. but no, it fits well in my pockets and the screen is awesome!!!!"
248,5,"love the new iphone, great phone, awesome camera. Love it"
249,5,"I love my I-phone 8 plus. It is big enough to see, but not too big to hols. Pictures are great. It was not a hard adjustment from my 6. It did take a second to get use to the button pressure. I also added an app that tkes me to the home page."
250,5,"I bought this phone last week, it’s a very good phone, fast, more features than my previous phone, I recommend this Phone"
251,5,Always happy with Apple phones. My only suggestion would be for the salesperson to share a brief summary/highlights of what the new phone version brings.
252,5,Phone is great but it sucks Apple makes you buy a new phone every 2 years
253,5,My wife loves this phone but we are disappointed with Apple making u buy a phone every 2 years
254,4,"Phone has everything I need, making the X an unnecessary waste of extra money. Get the 8 plus"
255,4,"Phone purchase suggested by our son, who has used iPhones for years. Learning transition from years of android use. Not finding degree symbol on keypad."
256,5,I love my new phone. The sales associate was helpful in familiarizing me with it. It's much faster and easier to use than my old phone.
257,5,Great phone really recommend this phone to everybody!!!!
258,5,We've always had Android phones but the kids wanted Apple phones because they use Aplle computers in school. We'll see if the phones bring the grades up
259,5,Great camera and the bigger size works well for me!
260,5,"I was OK with the price, but I love the phone. They did not have a big selection of colors but I was OK with that."
261,5,I'm glad I went with the 8 plus instead of the X. My cousin did research and the 8 plus is much better than the X and less frustrating.
262,5,Great phone for price. Nice large display! My girls love it!
263,5,"We love our IPhone 8+. Great sound for movie, video watching, love the new camera"
264,5,Bought the phone for my Child. Love all of the great Parental controls.
265,5,I love the new camera. Apple makes the best phones with best service.
266,5,Love the IPhone 8 Plus. I have always owned Apple products. Love the quality and ease of use.
267,5,"I came from a 5 so it’s a big step up a lot faster and more features. I don’t think the reception is any better for calls. I set it up with iCloud and was easy. If you have Apple Music make sure you have playlists turned on in the library home screen. That setting didn’t seem to transfer from backup. Verizon was a pain, I had to call 800 automated line to activate. The information was right online but just would not take."
268,5,"My daughter's iPhone 5S began having numerous problems, therefore, I had to upgrade. Best Buy had a better deal on the iPhone 8 which overall will save me money. I had planned to get her the iPhone 7 but for a few dollars more we were able to get 256GB which is best for my daughter! Audrey and Karl were AWESOME knowing I had limited time, they worked as a team and had me in and out with time to spare! Great service and wonderful to see how professional they were working together!"
269,5,"The iPhone 8 is awesome. It is fast, responsive, and easy to both set up and use. I upgraded from an iPhone 6, and the differences are monumental."
270,5,Love my new phone! Takes great pictures and video!
271,4,She loves the phone and the ease of use between all her apple products. She can text like lightening!
272,4,"I bought this phone to replace my mom's old laggy iPhone 6+. She likes it and she easily learned all the new features quickly. Thank you Best Buy for setting up her new phone for her before she left the store. My mom is having a minor issue with her new phone. When she is in a low signal area or overly congested area, call quality sounds terrible on the person she called side.The call comes in clear on her end, but on the other end the call quality is very muffled, staticky, and has an echoing effect. I don't know if this a Apple issue or Verizon issue. According to her, Its only happened a few times over a course of a month. Besides that issue, she likes the phone a lot over her old iPhone."
273,5,"The iPhone X gets all the love (justifiably so) but this is is a great upgrade from previous models Fast great screen and camera, great speakers and battery life. Powerhouse"
274,5,"It was a gift for my daughter, and she loved it. She said it was so easy to use it!!"
275,4,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6s and there really isn’t much new to this one. It has the wireless charging capability, which is cool, but everything else is essentially the same. That’s not a bad thing since the 6s was very good but there aren’t really enough improvements to make it worth the upgrade u less you are having issues with your current phone and need something new. It’s a great phone though."
276,5,"Overall the phone is great, faster than my last IPhone, better screen, better pictures."
277,5,Phone fits perfect. Screens seemlesly transition. The pictures are perfect.
278,5,"Loving my new iPhone 8! I’m way more careful with this one since it has a glass back, however, the color is pretty and looks good with the case I bought!"
279,5,"The iPhone 8Plus is a major upgrade from my old 6 Plus. Extremely fast and the quality of the picture is great. Miss the headphone jack when bluetooth headphones are charging. Great battery life. I get a full day with heavy use (email, gaming, internet searches). The best battery life of any iPhone I ever had (since first iteration)."
280,5,Upgraded from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 8 Plus. Very similar to iPhone 7 Plus. Do like the wireless charging capability.
281,4,He had a android before. He likes this better easier to operate
282,5,"My 4th iPhone and this one is wonderful. I like the larger screen for easier reading, and the larger keypad for easier texting. I highly recommend the iPhone 8+"
283,5,My grandson picked out this phone and he loves it! Very cool!
284,5,I kept running out of space for pictures and mi games
285,5,Bought this on the 24 month plan. Was a better deal than the 7. As of now seemed like a smart purchase.
286,5,The iPhones just keep getting better and better! I love the camera on this one.
287,5,Pretty consistent upgrade from the 6 to the 8... Works as advertised
288,5,"I thought it’d be too big, but I got used to the size quickly and have no intention of going back to buying smaller phones. The camera is amazing, the sound is surprisingly good and the screen is very nice too."
289,5,A good phone for your everyday needs and more! Great quality and wonderful service.
290,5,Great phone with all the features you want to have
291,5,Great phone with all the features you would want to have
292,5,I will never have an android phone for the rest of my life. JJG
293,5,"I love my new phone, especially the battery, it holds up very well."
294,3,The iPhone-8 is an average phone (for now). I hope the IOS and battery will last a bit longer (this time).
295,5,Replaced my 6S with this phone. Great apple product that I am used to.
296,5,Love the way I can go from one thing to another much faster than before!!
297,5,Unfortunately I was forced to buy a new iPhone because my IPhone 5 would no longer hold a charge
298,2,"The first phone they gave me in the store completely malfunctioned before I left. Had to get me another. My old IPhone died before it was even paid off. They couldn't help me retrieve my info. Longtime Apple user, thinking of switching to another kind of phone."
299,5,Upgraded my daughter's aging iPhone 6 and she loves it. It's much faster and she is learning to use the new features of the phone. Lot of accessories for the phone as well.
300,5,Got this phone for my boyfriend's mom as her first cell phone and its amazing. Definately user friendly we both have Samsung's and i am still able to help her set it up.
301,5,I bought this phone for my mom. The camera is perfect. Easy for her to use and the picture is clear and concise.
302,5,This is an upgrade from an iPhone 6 and is much faster. Love the bigger screen.
303,5,"Love the new iPhone. Upgrading from a 6, a lot of new features"
304,4,"Love the iphones, have had them since the original. This 8 is great, but wish I would have gotten an X."
305,5,"love the new iPhone 8, the battery life is amazing compared to old iPhone"
306,5,"You could never go wrong with an iPhone. I didn't buy the X because I wasn't ready to let go of the home button just yet, but hey...maybe next years upgrade? ;)"
307,5,I Like the 8 the 10 is overrated and over priced it does have the similar features compared to the 10.
308,5,Great phone. Excellent clarity. Good upgrade from the 6plus
309,5,Excellent phone. Great upgrade from the 6 they had.
310,5,I upgraded my child to an iPhone 8 from a 6 and of course she loves it. She loved the Rose Gold color too!
311,5,I was unsure as to upgrading to a Plus but I realize how much I needed a larger phone!
312,5,This purchase was for my daughter and she loves it. She is upgrading from IPHONE 6.
313,5,"I am came from a 6s and wanted a bigger screen. Really like it, wavered a bit because it is a little heavier than the 6s but was able to move past it. The camera is much improved from the 6s. It's a great phone!"
314,5,"Great pictures, faster and reliable, easy to use!."
315,5,Nice phone and I like the better cameras that it’s equipped with over my iPhone 6. Comfortable to use too while surfing the web
316,5,Compared to my old iPhone 5 this iPhone 8 is great. Much easier to read screen without needing glasses and less glare. Nice iPhone.
317,5,"Color is so beautiful. Phone is perfect size, fast and efficient. Downfall is it does not have portrait mode like the plus"
318,5,"Big but awesome. Fast, portrait camera is awesome, but too big for a pocket"
319,5,I love my phone I got mainly for the camera to take pictures of my kids and it’s very clear and perfect
320,5,"I love this phone. faster then my 6s plus. Camera is great, the feel of the phone is very similar to my 6s plus so didn’t need to get use to anything new."
321,5,All the features that I need ... it certainly fits my budget!
322,5,Works like every other iPhone. Fast and reliable. No complaints
323,5,Great help great phone Was a great experience buying it there
324,4,I bought this as a gift for my son for Christmas. This was an upgrade for him. This is the way I keep in touch with my family over the miles. That makes this phone so worth the cost.
325,5,"Very intuitive phone, easy setup and easy to use. Excellent camera options!"
326,3,The iPhone doesn't seem to be as user friendly as the Samsung Note 8.
327,5,"Bought my wife the 8 plus because she wanted something bigger, but doesn’t need anything crazy high tech. She loves it and it’s the perfect size."
328,5,"Much faster, sharper camera - get the extra memory!"
329,5,The speed is faster and the pictures are brilliant!
330,5,I have used the type of phone for the past few years and it’s great.
331,5,The camera is awesome. Love the feel of this camera and ease of use.
332,5,I got this phone for my son to replace his old iphone which was out of space. Hoping this one lasts longer than longer than 2 years.
333,5,I upgraded from iphone 5 and am very happy. Lots of new features and looks beautiful.
334,5,Had a 5C and wanted to get a phone for my daughter. I upgraded and love the phone.
335,5,Upset I had to buy a new phone because Apple slowed their batteries down. I am happy with the 8 though.
336,5,Happy with this phone so far. Good screen size and very vast processing
337,5,I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6plus. The camera is much better on the 8 plus. Apps load faster. I’m very happy with my phone so far.
338,4,Its better than the I phone 6 I had that stopped working or charging
339,5,"I upgraded my daughter's phone, she went from and IPhone 6 to the 8 plus and she loves it, she takes lots of pictures and she is in love with this phone's camera She is used to the bigger size now, I thought it was going to be a problem but she said it's perfect"
340,5,This was my first apple and it has not disappointed. Great phone.
341,5,"I bought this phone last week, I really like it, very good phone more features than my previous phone, I recommend this....."
342,5,"I gave this phone to my spouse as an upgrade from her iPhone 5, she loved it, especially the storage (256). Also compatible with her Mac computer, and Face Time with family."
343,5,I really like the change. It’s been much smoother than I assumed it would be. I still struggle with some things but I have friends that are iPhone users to help. The speaker could be louder but other than that I love everything about the phone!
344,5,"No complaints , best phone and best place to buy it at"
345,5,Needed an upgrade. Camera is a definite improvement.
346,5,Excellent camera great size and color. Not to heavy
347,3,I am a little disappointed in the iPhone 8 It really is not much different than my iPhone 6 I had but much more expensive.
348,5,A lot of bells and whistles without the cost of the X. The camera is a noted improvement!
349,5,I got this for my daughter to replace an older model iPhone and she loves it. It’s got a huge screen and it’s a big large but it performs great and she loves it.
350,5,Love it. Was an android person since cell phones came out. But want face time. Switch did take some patience to learn the Apple way. Now would not switch back
351,5,If you're considering buying this phone you won't regret it. It does take a little while to adjust to (especially coming from my Samsung) but it's so worth it! The battery life is amazing! It'll be one of the best purchases you make!
352,5,Upgraded my iPhone 7plus and got the 8plus the phones are exactly the same. No issues here
353,5,"I knew it was due time I upgraded my 6, so when I started doing research, everything kept drawing me to the 8. There was a noticeable difference in the upgrade, due to the quality of the phone itself, but also the features and clarity being projected. I love my new iPhone and if I had to do it over again, I would still select the 8 Plus."
354,5,Replaced my phone with the larger sized model. I like how easy it is to read messages and email. The camera is great.
355,5,Replaced my phone with this newer model. Like the camera.
356,5,I replaced the iPhone 6 with the iPhone 8. Love the new features.
357,5,I recently upgraded my iphone 6 to the iphone 8. The picture quality is better. I love this phone.
358,5,"Love this iPhone. The cameras are great, and it has the same chipset as the X."
359,4,"I upgraded from 6s Plus to the 8 Plus, and I’m very pleased! Apps don’t glitch, the camera functionality is superior, battery life is WAY better, and it seems to run more smoothly. The only irritation I have is that my mail app, every couple weeks, will act like it’s reloading all of my emails from scratch like it would the first time you set it up, which uses a ton of internet bandwidth and slows the phone a bit. Other than that, the phone is great and I’m very pleased with my choice!!"
360,5,Love the 8 Plus! Awesome phone. Upgraded from a 6 and super happy with my decision!
361,5,I purchased this phone for my 19 year old son as a gift. He loves it. I fell in love with the color. It is a great phone with new and improved apps and camera.
362,5,I am really happy with this iPhone. Great size. Faster. And my old EMF protection works well with it!!
363,5,You matched att store price and had the amount of phones I needed. You salespeople were very good and helpful. I also got a Best Buy credit card.
364,5,So excited to find the phone off her dreams... Thrilled to have an iphone.
365,5,"Not many changes that I can notice besides it’s a bit faster than the 7. Other than that, same phone. Hope this one doesn’t crash!"
366,5,Ended up buying another one for my teenage daughter because I love it so much!
367,5,I've been an Apple product fan for several years and intend on staying that way. The iPhone 8 is another great product in Apple's line up.
368,4,So i’m not too please with the iphone 8 it’s not much of a difference from the 7 expect you can charge it wireless I guess that’s cool.
369,5,"My daughter got this and she loves the phone plenty of space good camera, it’s way faster then her old 6s"
370,5,"My only complaint so far is that the phone itself is slick and flies out of my hands way too easily! had to get a sticky cover so the phone doesn't slide out of my hands just holding it. Still having to get used to the new layout and missing some of my apps because the developer is behind the times and hasn't updated the app, but I am very happy 1 month in."
371,5,This 8 plus is truly an upgrade from 6s. Love this phone.
372,5,"It’s an Apple product, what more is there to say???"
373,5,"I bought the IPhone 8 Plus and thought about returning it for Samsung Note Or IPhone X. Glad I kept the 8. I like that it’s familiar with some newer twists. The texting is better( not so many unwanted words being sent) and it’s much faster. Camera is really nice. I had to turn off Siri because it was always popping up when I pressed the home button. All in all, I’ll hang with Apple for a while and see how they improve the X."
374,5,Very happy with my 8. Good value upgrade from my iPhone 6s.
375,5,"Good size, love the picture quality, love the color."
376,5,"Good picture quality, good size, love the color, love so far."
377,5,Like the speed of the operating system; nice size for the hand; fast wireless charging. Nice improvement over the 7 Plus.
378,5,My daughter swears by apple products. She likes the things that she can do with it
379,5,Continues to be easy to use and many good features and functions.
380,5,Upgraded from the 6s plus and love it. Great investment for a phone.
381,5,Best iPhone ever love the camera an the wireless charger
382,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6 so this 8+ is definitely better! I have no complaints as of now.
383,5,Upgrade over the iPhone 6s Plus is well worth it. Great phone
384,5,Had the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8 Plus is much faster and has an excellent camera
385,5,Love the color of the rose gold. Great phone with great camera.
386,5,Love the new iPhone 8. A lot faster than the iPhone 6.
387,3,The home button drives me crazy it keeps taking me to Siri
388,4,It will take getting used to. Touch screen and buttons feel different.
389,5,"Moved up from iphone6. Camera is improved, processing is a little faster, and battery life is longer. Glad I made the switch"
390,5,Love the phone. My daughter was right in getting me to choose the plus.
391,5,Very happy with my new cell Love the silver color.
392,5,I am an Apple fan. I have yet to be disappointed in the products that I have purchased from them.
393,3,The 8 is exactly like an iPhone 7 only with fingerprint coding to unlock. Suggest if you have an iPhone 7 to not up grade to an 8 or x
394,5,It's a better iphone that has a great resolution for pictures.
395,5,"This phone was bought for my 16yr old, it has worked great and has great features. Definitely will keep the apple lover happy!!!"
396,5,Phone was purchased for my daughter which was great. But we had someone help us who had no experience and didn't bother transferring all my daughter's info from her own phone.
397,5,"This was an upgrade to her 6S, and she's really happy with it so far. It's fast and much more space for storage compared to her old phone."
398,5,We received good service with big purchase decisions. Husband switched to iphone after years and so far he’s pleased.
399,5,"My daughter loves this thing, then again what 11 year old wouldn't."
400,5,Good update. Fast processsor. Very happy with our purchase.
401,5,"Great phone, son loves new features from the 6s version."
402,5,I needed an upgrade pretty bad and this phone is very sleek and I love the color. I do recommend the glass screen protector for it. I’m still figuring out all of the features and the battery life so far is good.
403,5,This iPhone was the best purchase of 2017. I love the 8 plus
404,5,Great phone with great features. Daughter loves the new camera.
405,5,"Purchased phone for 16 year old daughter. She loves the phone, camera and larger size screen."
406,5,The iPhone 8 is an awesome phone. Nice design and quality.
407,5,love it works easy smooth transitions doesnt lag like some of the others.
408,5,"Great phone, great camera, easy to set up and tons of storage."
409,5,The best phone on the market! I can’t wait to use the wireless charging feature!
410,5,"Have been a Samsung Galaxy owner since the S4. Good phones, I never made the change due to freedom etc. what made me change was reliability. And well a lot of reviews and close friends told me Apple is more reliable and so far I have had phone for about 2 weeks w all the apps I had on my s7 edge and it’s running smooth and battery last longer"
411,5,Perfect size great camera easy to work beginner very satisfied
412,5,"The best phone in the market for now, The camera is highly awesome"
413,5,Better camera and a bigger screen. All around thumbs up
414,4,Just replacing my old iPhone 6. Did not want the X (ten) because of the facial recognition.
415,5,Best phone on the market. The camera is amazing. Not to mention the staff was very helpful.
416,4,"The phone functions just fine. It’s fast (of course, it’s new) and the perfect size. The only thing they seemed to be able to brag about was the glass back for wireless charging...which is nice but adds to the fragility of this phone. Not much else is new! I upgraded from a 6."
417,5,"I wasn't going too upgrade from my i-phone 6 too the 8, the 6 is working just fine, BUT I decided too go for it, Holy Moly what a difference, why did I wait so long, the câmara is my favorite it's awesome, I just got so I'm still figuring everything out, Don't wait go get one.."
418,5,Easy to use and a strong upgrade from my 2 year old 6S
419,4,nice product odd to handle at first......................
420,5,Great photos! Longer battery life than the 6s. Would definitely purchase again!
421,5,I love the phone. The size does take some getting use to after having a smaller phone.
422,1,I purchased this iPhone as a Christmas gift for my grandson (age 22). He has a photography hobby and owns many cameras. He is delighted by the quality of photographs taken with the iPhone 8 plus. On the day of the purchase I learned of the AT&T promotion offering two phones for the price of one. I took advantage of the promotion and have upgraded my phone from a 6 plus to an 8 plus.
423,5,faster and better than its previous version. love the screen and the seamless operation
424,5,"I had the iPhone 6, decided on the iPhone 8 plus. Really glad I went to plus size (i had resisted for a long time- didn't want something big) but now I don't know why I waited this long. I really like the size."
425,5,Upgraded from a iPhone 6 and I’m very happy about the new phone.
426,5,This was a upgrade for my son which was still using an iPhone 5.
427,4,"Much faster than my iPhone 6 was even when the iPhone 6 was new. Battery life is pretty good. Invest in case and screen protector, cannot stress this enough. Scratches way too easily because of coating on the glass."
428,3,So far the iPhone 8 Plus is doing good. It has been working good
429,3,"So my daughter's iphone 5c was aging, being nearly 4 years old, and my iPhone 6 stopped working correctly, and I'm watching the lawsuit against Apple with glee. I wanted to go Samsung, but she loves apple, so I took one for the team, fully charged my ""6"" so it would work when evaluated for trade in, and got this phone as the 'buy one' part of the special AT&T was running under their Next program. Of course, my '6' was a 64Gb, and was nearly full after 3 1/2 years, so I sort of talked myself into getting the 256Gb beast. Apple could simplify all of our lives (theirs and ours) by just providing a slot for a standard memory expansion card (micro SD?) like other makers do for Android phones. Would make transferring or printing photos ever so much less sucky. BB staff was decent to work with, although some of the conversations between team members about disciplinary discussions were kind of unprofessional. Keep that stuff in the break room please."
430,3,"So my daughter's iphone 5c was aging, being nearly 4 years old, and my iPhone 6 stopped working correctly, and I'm watching the lawsuit against Apple with glee.

BB staff was decent to work with, although some of the conversations between team members about disciplinary discussions were kind of unprofessional."
431,5,"I'm so glad I went to Best Buy to buy our iPhones! The service was amazing and we are so happy with the selection they had, even right after the 8's were released!"
432,5,Love the picture quality. And storage in my phone yeah
433,5,This was a replacement for an iPhone 6s that our son likes but he hasn't really changed what he does and it used 10 gigabytes of data in the first month. Before he was using about 4 gigabytes of data. We will take it to a Verizon store to see if they can help us fix it
434,4,"Due to ""battery"" conspiracy with Apple, I upgraded to the iPhone 8 Plus rather than the iPhone X. There have been too many problems with the X, and it is not the size of the Plus devices, so I will have to hold out until next year. HOWEVER, THIS PHONE IS NOT THAT BAD AT ALL!"
435,5,"I have had each plus since the 6, I wouldn’t have upgraded so soon but my 7 started acting up and so I jumped the gun and just upgraded. Well instead of the Best Buy members just looking to see if they could help me with my old phone they just jumped on the sale of course and come to find out I just needed to upgrade to the new update on my 7. So now I feel like I have two of the same exact phones. Cannot tell any difference between the two."
436,5,apple doesnt fail with the iphone 8 i have been a user for years and will continue
437,5,I love the size of the screen and the resolution. : )
438,5,"Love the massive size. Has some great features my iPhone 6 didn't have. Like the screen size, camera options. Quality phone!"
439,5,"Nothing much has changed, but the camera on this thing is legit!"
440,5,Highly recommend the iPhone 8 for anyone interested in getting an iPhone
441,4,Got this phone for my wife as an upgrade from her iPhone 6. Better camera with the 8. She loves it.
442,5,I looked over several phones and finally came back and purchased the iPhone 8. Other phones seem to want to be what iPhone already is. They may have 1 or 2 specialty features but the iPhone 8 blows them away with all it offers.
443,4,I got this for my daughter. It is a perfect phone for a teen.
444,5,Good built and camera quality. Upgraded ithe device after long time and can see visible difference from last handset.!
445,5,This is my first Iphone. I have been a Samsung Galaxy user for the last several years. There is no comparison to the Iphone. So many more user friendly apps that are Iphone supported.
446,5,"Sure I am a lemming who has bought into the iOS universe. Fine. But this is a nice upgrade from my SE, which was just under two years old and is still running well and holding a charge. Haptic feedback is smooth and was an easy transition, and I now need a slightly larger screen. OLED is stunning! All around we are very pleased, especially with the BOGO, which is not as easy to find with our particular carrier."
447,5,"Upgrade from an iPhone 6, love the bigger screen, the much improved camera and excellent speed of this new phone. Also like the wireless charging capability.Only downside is the hefty weight of the phone, but that's the price you pay for the bigger screen."
448,5,"Outstanding improvement with camera versus my iPhone 6s Plus. The portrait mode is awesome. The new os is smooth as silk, due to improved processor, and the battery life is significantly better."
449,5,I'm not an iPhone person but my kids are...he is a happy guy
450,5,Bought this for my son for Christmas and he love's it
451,5,Upgraded from 6 & am very impressed with how much better this phone is. It’s faster & holds a charge a lot longer.
452,5,I purchase this phone for my daughter and she loves it
453,5,"great , great , great ,great, great, great, great,"
454,5,"apple items are very good products to by for gifts,"
455,5,If you’re a apple person this is the phone for you.
456,5,"Great camera, great picture. Works good with my Mac laptop"
457,5,One of the best iPhone. If you have been on the fence regarding upgrading I would highly recommend to upgrade to the iPhone 8 Plus! Stand out features: - Great display - Long last battery - Wireless charging - Quick charging - Fast processor The iPhone 8 Plus is a great buy highly recommended!
458,5,My old phone was a 5s thus the improvements are striking. Much to learn but initial use of the camera is very impressive
459,5,"We were initially very skeptical about the size of the 8+, as we upgraded from the 5! However, we love it!!! We also are really enjoying The extra storage and the absence of the “not storage” pop up!! Love the upgraded camera/photo options. Amazing!"
460,5,Although it took sometime to get working just with plan changes and activation this is a great phone.
461,5,at first my wife thought this would be too large - wouldn’t fit in hands or pockets and be too hard to adjust to. after a few weeks it’s hard to imagine what we were using before. we BOTH got one of these. she really likes the white color. i went with black. so far so great.
462,5,iphone is the standard for me. i’ve had just about every incarnation.. keep coming back b/c they just always work. never had a bad one. the X is way overpriced. hope they work that situation out.
463,5,"My son loves this phone and says it has a really nice camera. Once you go to the larger phones, you never go back."
464,4,My new 8 iPhone receives better WiFi and Bluetooth connection than the 5S I previously owned. I like the slightly big size. Battery of course last longer
465,5,Always love the iphones. Takes a little getting used to but I wouldn’t get anything else
466,5,I really can’t tell a difference between the IPhone 7 & IPhone 8. I don’t think I’ll ever lease a phone again. I’d rather pay it out over 24 Months and keep the phone
467,5,So far this has been my favorite iPhone. The size takes getting used to but the larger viewing screen is amazing!
468,5,"Fast,great camera and everything that the iPhone do."
469,5,For the price and memory it’s a great product. Camera is great too
470,4,Seems to be a lot faster and so much better than my last phone holder better charge and I love the wireless charging
471,5,Another great addition to the iPhone legacy. Very happy with the purchase.
472,5,My grandbaby loves it so far I hope I continue like this it great.
473,5,Wife's iPhone 6 would not work even after changing battery. Time for an upgrade. Huge leap in storage and features for her. She loves it so far.
474,5,"I was convinced last year I would buy the new iPhone X when it was released. All the leaked photos, specs, etc., made it my clear choice of my new upgrade. Then I went into Best Buy and actually held the X. First impressions: it's small. But this is because I have always used the plus sized phones when possible. Screen looked great. However, when I pulled up some videos and did a side-by-side comparison with the 8s Plus, I knew I wanted the 8. The screens look identical with great resolutions. Colors are bright and vivid, even ""crisp"" if that is word that can be used to describe colors. But, despite the fact that the X screen is just slightly larger than the 8s Plus, the videos were smaller. Much smaller. This is because of the screen ratio being slightly less wide than the 8s Plus. For me, this alone was the deal breaker. I can do without the talking emojis. That would get old for me real quick. I like seeing my screen big and bright. The X is bright, big, but not when it comes to videos, Netflix, etc. That's really the only drawback. Oh, and my 8s Plus was $200 less. Sold."
475,5,"The iPhone 8 has practically all the features of the iPhone X but at a much lower cost. Good size, easy to handle, and Apple quality."
476,5,Love the upgrades! Would recommend protective case since the back is now glass too.
477,4,"Love this iPhone, I’ve had apple products since the very first Mac book and iPhone and I recommend Apple every time. Their product may be priciest compared to “ Microsoft “ but I’ve owned both types in laptop and phone version and Apple products have always been virus free maintenance free and trouble free for me, I have never had issues with Apple!!"
478,5,This is my first smart phone. I chose a IPhone because it is set up just like my iPad. Love the size of the plus. Looked at the reviews for the different iPhones and decided on the 8 Plus. I liked the 8 Plus better than the X.
479,5,I went from the Galaxy S6 Edge plus to the 8 plus and I absolutely love it! What a super sleek phone! Everyone should have it!
480,4,"The iPhone eight downloads rapidly. The typing out of voicemail messages seems to be a good idea. I am enjoying the low light camera. I still prefer the size of the iPhone 5 at this point. For some reason,the phone seems to require more data than my previous phone. This phone seems to make more mistakes in “talk to text“ then my previous phone, but maybe it will get used to my speech after a while. It made about 15 mistakes as I tried to “talk to text” this review, for example. The battery also seems to deplete quicker than I expected. Mostly, though, I expect to get used to it and it’s new features overtime and to enjoy how many things you can do for me."
481,4,I upgraded from the iPhone 6 and I guess I expected a little more. The battery life does seem to be a lot better though.
482,3,My last 6s was perfectly fine until all of a sudden my battery started acting weird. So I got the new phone instead of a battery.
483,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6. The iPhone 8 is much faster & I like the convenience of wireless charging.
484,5,If you are a fan of the iphone than this one is what you are looking for. If you have a older one consider replacing the battery if you don't want to spend money on a new phone.
485,5,Phone is great slick and works great with all my apps
486,5,Love this phone! Easy to use and big screen for older eyes.
487,5,My son loves his new phone!! He didn't have any problems setting up his phone or using his phone.
488,5,Love my New Apple 8+. Very fast and reliable. Battery life is also great!
489,5,"My second Iphone, excellent product. Concerned about recent battery issue, but flawless thus far."
490,5,"I love the rose gold color, it's gorgeous! I bought a clear cover so the color will still show in its protected case."
491,5,"But the iPhone 8's camera alone is so far superior, battery life is excellent, & option for wireless charging is magical."
492,5,I absolutely love this phone!!!!!! It does everything for me!!!!! Definitely happy I didn’t wait to get the iPhone X!!!!!
493,5,Bigger screen for better viewing and great for web surfing!
494,5,My best ever phone by far it is much faster than iphone 7
495,5,Very happy with my new iPhone however found that apple caused the problems with the batteries on purpose!! Very upset with apple
496,5,This phone is awesome! Does everything I need it to do and more
497,5,"I bought this phone right before the iPhone X came out and I am glad I did. It is very fast, has a beautiful screen and a very capable camera. Plus it is relatively cheap compared to the other flagship phones that came out this year."
498,5,Excellent phone. Was hesitant to choose between iPhone X and 8plus. Very happy I chose this phone.
499,5,"Holds a charge very well, camera works great and I can make telephone calls with it!"
500,4,"Decent phone. Nothing special about it. Basically just like my 6S Plus. Works, and that’s the main thing."
501,5,"Great phone, a bit heavy but takes great pictures."
502,5,I love this phone. Camera is great. Love the extra starting storage space
503,5,Phone is awesome screen is much bigger from upgrading from a 6s. Black color is much better than gray
504,5,Phone is awesome screen is much bigger from upgrading from a 6s
505,5,Phone works great. Love the front and back camera. Very pleased with battery life also.
506,5,I am really glad I upgraded my phone to the 8. Pictures are clearer & features are worth it.
507,4,"Upgraded from a iPhone 6s Plus. Got this instead of the 8 because I liked the bigger phone. But since my iOS updated before I got the new phone, I don’t really notice anything that would be worth upgrading from a 6 to an 8."
508,5,I had an iPhone 6s and this phone is user friendly as well with more bells and whistles. Good alternative to the more expensive iPhone X.
509,5,The iPhone 8 is a nice upgrade from the 6. The processor is faster and the camera is a good upgrade.
510,5,This phone is pretty much like prior models but new.
511,5,"This is my wife's phone, she upgraded from Iphone 7, she is getting used to the larger size but other then that she loves it."
512,5,"If you like iPhones this will be no different. Ive always had an iPhone and am happy with the ease of use. This is my first time with the Plus model. Still getting used to the size, but no a big deal."
513,5,Very happy with the new phone I was due for an upgrade for a long time. Phone is reliable battery life is much better than before.
514,5,I have always been an android user but this new phone is amazing.
515,5,I love apple so when I had to up grade I got a 8....love it pictures are great....and wireless charge
516,4,"I mean it’s an iPhone, what can I really say. It was a great door buster deal when I purchased and I was forced to upgrade from a 6 due to software compatibility issues with AR Apps."
517,5,It's a iPhone what more do I have to say....we needed new phones so we upgraded
518,5,My wife is very pleased with this latest rendition.
519,5,I wanted a IPhone with a larger screen and more memory and the 8 plus does the job. I love that it was available in gold tone.
520,5,As expected the upgrade was seemless and the phone is great. Really like the water resistant and larger screen the 8 plus provides.
521,5,"iPhone 8 Plus is exceptional, just like its ancestors. Very happy with no complaints."
522,5,The best camera I have ever had on a mobile phone. The wireless charger ability is great too.
523,5,"Went from a 6 to an 8, nothing much to say, it’s an iPhone."
524,5,"Went from a 6 to the 8. Much faster but not much to say, it’s an iPhone."
525,5,"So far, I really like this phone. The cost is pretty high but that’s Apple I guess."
526,4,"I like Apple products in general, but that said the prices are rather absurd. Nice upgrade from a 5."
527,4,The salesman could of been a lil more patient with me
528,4,So far an excellent phone. Battery life is good. Ear phones little funny
529,5,Very satisfied with the iPhone 8 Plus and it has exceeded all my expectations on performance. I was a little worried it might be too big coming off the iPhone 5s but I found it is perfect.
530,5,I live the phone and the amount of space. I love the size of the phone too
531,5,This iPhone works perfectly on the AT&T network. Very satisfied!
532,4,Haven’t had the phone long but the only difference I notice between this and my iPhone 6 is the battery life and the camera are better
533,5,Bought this phone for my teenage daughter she loves it. Great camera!
534,4,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift, no complaints thus far."
535,5,We got this for my daughter for Christmas she loves it!
536,4,Upgraded from iPhone 6s. Both ny husband and I had problems with our 6s. So far we are pleased.
537,5,My son was very happy to receive his christmas present. Best present ever
538,5,Would have like the iPhone X but it was too expensive. Love the portrait mode in this phone. Wish they would have done it on the iPhone 8 too. The size of this phone is a little jig for my hands
539,5,Bought two for Christmas gifts when they were on sell to replace the 6 that was running slow and shutting down. Works like all the rest of the iphones. Just cost way too much!
540,5,Love this phone.........................................................................................................
541,5,So far so good. Lots of new features. Amazing camera. Easy to navigate still
542,5,I'm very happy with this phone. It is the best one I have had so far and the camera part of it is just icing on the cake. I'm very pleased with the speed of the phone and apps as well as the screen is large enough for me to see easily. The camera also rocks if i have not mentioned that yet.
543,5,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6 and am happy that I did. The 8 is not much different, so nothing new to learn. Im glad I upgraded."
544,5,I am not quite sure if this is better than the X but for me it is just what I wanted and needed for the time being. It does what every other Iphone SHOULD do.
545,4,"What's there to say... it's an iPhone, just like the model before it, but slightly faster with more storage. Yay."
546,5,I once again am very pleased with my iPhone purchase.
547,5,This was a great upgrade for my wife! She had a 6 previous that was slow and took great pictures
548,5,So far so good. I got my son the 7 and i upgraded myself to the 8.
549,5,"This is one the best apple phones ever! Great picture quality, sound and size! This is a must for diehard apple fans!"
550,5,So far this iphone 8 plus works great. Have had no problems since buying it three weeks ago.
551,5,I’m coming from the IPhone 5S and I feel like wow this is new smart phone technology. Simple yet “perfect” really love the HD camera and live picture feature.
552,4,Apple next generation iPhone is really nice easier to use but a little too big
553,5,I wanted a bigger size and this phone is great ...
554,5,Kids love this and I have had fun playing when they let me. 5 Star!
555,5,Very happy with my new phone to replace an Iphone 6 that had seen better days.
556,5,upgraded from IPhone 6. The features on this phone are worth the upgrade.
557,5,"Had the 6 prior and now enjoying the new features, would have liked to know about the batter cpu slowdowns bad kept my old phone, but either way enjoying this new iPhone"
558,5,"My wife loves this device. Her only complaint was adjusting to the large size. She loves everything about it - speed of processing, ease of use, and size of storage (256G). I’ve made a monster and now she’s always going to want a “phablet”. I ordered this for self install and had no problem setting it up at home."
559,5,Apple upgrade #3. We love the operating system and Apple features.
560,5,My daughter’s first choice! Very pleased with that choice.
561,5,"I was nervous about the larger screen, but in the end... I love it!!"
562,4,I am upgrading from an iPhone 6. Awesome and powerful phone.
563,5,I’ve owned many iPhones and the 8 still works as well as others. The volume on it doesn’t seem as loud as previous models but everything else is what you would expect in iPhone series.
564,5,Great phone excellent reception and style one of a kind
565,4,It runs a lot faster than my iPhone 6s and has a much better camera.
566,4,"Great camera, better than the previous iPhone 6s. Recommend."
567,5,Love the Phone. Great Apple Product. B Easy to set up and transfer all the data and history from my previous Iphine.
568,4,Upgrading from iPhone 6 to iPhone 8. Great upgrade value relative to price.
569,5,"I upgraded from a 6+. Not that different, but it is faster"
570,5,"Best iPhone yet, totally satisfied and could not be better"
571,1,Not a fan of the iPhone after I bought this one going back to Samsung
572,5,I upgraded from a Samsung S7 to this Iphone and I wish I had done it earlier. The battery life is well beyond my expectations and the phone itself is very responsive.
573,5,Thank you for helping me shoose my product I will recommend you guys.
574,5,My daughter has no complaints on it. She loves it with no glitches noted.
575,5,Bought for my wife as a gift hope she likes it! Great iPhone
576,5,"Still playing around with it, buido far so good..."
577,4,It is very nice unlocked phone I neve to have before.
578,5,Up graded daughters iPhone she loves it great phone.
579,5,Upgraded from iPhone 6 Plus. Great phone. Nice up grade.
580,5,What can I say this is my fish I phone and no problems so far they are user friendly and easy to use.
581,5,has all the necessary feature of iPhone without costing an arm and a leg
582,5,Thanks to Best Buy great costumer service thanks..
583,5,"Holds up to the expectations I have of iPhone so far! I had my 5, and 6s plus both for 2 years and never had any functionality, battery life, or any issues from them. They were in perfect condition when I upgraded. Hoping for the same with this one!"
584,5,Its an Apple. Be aware that ordering on line means the store won't help in set up-it's all you.
585,4,Bought a new iPhone for my son and took advantage of e BOGO deal. Best Buy Rep was great providing pricing and program options to help us the biggest bang for the buck.
586,5,Great product. Easy installation. Highly recommend.
587,4,Apple stayed consistent with this model. It’s not flashy but they upgraded some features on iOS that catch up with some cool Android features.
588,5,Better than expected. So many features and upgrades from my old iPhone 5. Definitely needed a new device.
589,5,I love the advances to the camera! Rhe wireless charging is so convenient
590,5,Daughter loves her new phone the iPhone 8 a better upgrade from the 5
591,3,So far I am undecided phone will shut off while in use haven’t figured out if it’s the new processor or an update that Apple has not sent out yet
592,5,Great camera quality my wife loves itWould recommend it to friends and family
593,5,Great camera quality I would recommend for any of my friends or family or coworkers break phone
594,4,This phone has a great camera. The battery life is unbelievable.
595,5,The camera is awesome. Very pleased. Apple has done it again.
596,5,"Great camera on this phone. Pictures look great, I get a lot of compliments!"
597,5,Love this phone. I have always owned Apple products because they are easy to use and durable.
598,4,The best I phone I have had and cheaper then the x and alimony every option
599,5,Better than my 6s. Prior to getting this phone I was sure that then6s was the best phone. 8 plus is now my favorite.
600,5,Bought this for my daughter for her birthday. Love the new features of the iPhone 8.
601,5,I ended up getting the iPhone 8 over the X. I figured the 8 was basically just as good and since I was buying it out right it was a lot cheaper.
602,5,My daughter loves this phone & it’s features!! It is a great Phone!!
603,5,This phone is amazing!!! I love the size of this phone & it’s features!!
604,5,"Love the iPhone 8! Coming from the 7, is by far the fastest iPhone yet, I wish I had gone with the x though just to change things up, but the 8 is amazing just my personal preference"
605,5,"I have been using Samsung for the last 6 years, I like this mobile very much"
606,5,"Again I'm an android fan and my wife isn't so upon her inspection, she raves about this phone."
607,5,"My old iPhone 6s was doing fine till I absolutely obliterated it. The reviews of the 8 were good enough so I went with 8 vs the 10 and saved a small amount of $$. Surprisingly the reviews of the 10 were less than desirable - another reason to pick the 8. It has performed flawlessly so far and is quite a lot like my old 6s, just a little faster. Good phone, recommended"
608,5,Upgraded from 6 Plus. Great phone and camera. Super fast. And was able to turn in my old phone for $180!
609,3,"Not much has really changed from the 6S to this, other than Apple won't start slowing this one down for a few years [hopefully]"
610,5,I have always been an Apple product fan and this purchase supported that.
611,5,So far so good. Bought for 18 year old boy. He like it so far
612,5,"Does everything I need it to do. Takes amazing pictures, is fast, etc. Great upgrade from the iPhone 6."
613,5,Glad we did the upgrade. Definitely faster than my previous iPhone.
614,5,"Quick and efficient, just as I hoped. Happy with my decision to upgrade!"
615,5,Awesome camera. It take pictures just like one of the expensive ones.
616,5,"Had a pleasant experience upgrading my phone at Best Buy. The salesman was professional, polite and courteous."
617,5,What can I say? It’s an iPhone. It works great and I am impressed with it. I haven’t had any problems or negatives to report.
618,5,Upgraded her from IPhone 6 to the 8plus and she love it
619,5,Great phone! Happy with it so far. Best Buy is the best place to get phones by far!!
620,5,What more to say. Apple I Phone 8. It is all that I expected and more. Thousands of positive reviews say it much better than me. I am not not a techno person but I find it easy to use and love it.
621,5,Apple continues to create great product. Very pleased with this device
622,4,"8 plus is large- almost too large, close to being a tablet on your ear."
623,4,Still subtle in color when placed in a protective case.
624,5,Love the size of it so easy to see and as always Apple is the best
625,4,"the 8 is an extension of all other iphones similar in function, this is a large phone takes a bit to get used to"
626,5,It is way cheaper than the iphone x but better than the 7.
627,4,definitely recommend. nice upgrade from the 6s plus
628,5,Daughter loves it. Awesome camera and fast internet.
629,5,"I found that my old iPhone wasn't keeping up to what I was used to so when Verizon came out with a rebate, I took advantage."
630,4,Camera is great and the screen has crisp quality. Same size as a 7 plus but better aspects.
631,5,"Large screen, easily handled, fast, once you go apple you can’t go back"
632,5,This phone is better than I expected. The speakers are good and the camera quality and zoom are great.
633,5,"Best Buy reps did a great job to upgrade my cellphone, transfer data and complete the transaction in a timely manner"
634,5,"I was torn between the 8+ and the 10. Ultimately I decided on the 8+, and am really happy with what it has to offer. The pictures are fantastic- clear as day. Great phone!"
635,5,Love love this phone!!! I would tell everyone about it
636,4,It’s an iPhone. It’s not much different than my last iPhone except it runs the latest iOS without having to worry about Apple’s intentional slow-down yet. I like the Plus- my last phone was standard size and I really love the larger screen. But it’s heavy. Sometimes the phone stops responding to touch screen for no apparent reason. This is concerning. And I may bring it up with Apple Support after a little google research. Overall - it’s really OK. It’s a good phone but probably not much better than any other good smart phone.
637,5,The camera is much better and my area of TX can get dusty quite often so I will really enjoy the dust resistance.
638,5,Another great phone from Apple. It feels a little lighter and I enjoy the larger screen of the Plus.
639,5,Got this on the buy one get one promotion with AT&T. My wife loves it.
640,5,"I needed to upgrade from my 6. I didn't care to spend the extra 300 for the X. This phone is just fine, and didn't take an time at all to learn the new features."
641,5,Great phone and great all around features at what is a reasonable price in today’s world
642,5,I love my phone it works great it is upgrades in the lot faster than my 6+ thanks
643,5,Good phone. It’s quick and has good storage for me probably too big for someone with small hands
644,5,the new I phone 8 is much clear photos and battery life lasts longer. the size is a litter larger and all apps much clearer
645,5,Love how easy it is to get a new phone at Best Buy. Walk in tell them what I want and walk out with my phone all set to use. Love the service and how much knowledge the workers have about the phone plans and phones.
646,4,I have had an iPhone 5 for years and it was time to upgrade. This phone works well and updates some of the problems I had with the 5. The 5 was a great device for the time but was not a great phone. Sound quality was poor. The 8 sounds much better.
647,5,"Enjoying the larger sized Plus, many useful features and a great camera!"
648,5,"I love my new phone. I upgraded from the 6 to the 8 plus . I was afraid of the size , but now I LOVE it!"
649,5,This iPhone 8 is by far the best iPhone I have owned. Plus the wireless charging is an amazing convenience with super quick charge ups.
650,5,I purchase this for my mom.. bestbuy had amazing deal got the phone free great camera and very fast
651,5,"Love my new iphone8. Perfect size to fit into my old case that I love, OS11 works great with it. And service by Best Buy made my purchase easy and quick"
652,5,I went from the Iphone 6 to this and it is amazing how much bigger the screen is. I look at my old phone now and can't believe how small it is!
653,5,I love the Apple phone and I had a great experience with the beat buy staff!
654,4,This phone has the best camera quality ever! I love it it!
655,4,It’s an iPhone just like the last ones and the coming ones nothing real special
656,5,"I've always been a fan of Apple products, and the new Iphone 8 is no exception. It has a great camera. The battery life is fantastic (unless you are FaceTiming which drains the battery faster). I thought I wouldn't like the no headphone jack gimmick, but nowadays most headphones are wireless anyways or you can use the headphone jack adapter, which really isn't as burdensome as I thought."
657,5,"Purchased iPhone 8+. I had the iPhone 5 before this. I know way past it’s prime but still functional. Very happy with the 8+ so far. Can see the screen much better, clearer pictures, easier to hear others talking, faster processing even with the videos and battery life is so much better. Took some time to get fingerprint log in to work. Had to delete and repeat a few times. Now with it working I do like it. It’s better than having to enter an eight digit pass code every time. Only had a four digit pass code on iPhone 5. Have the otter box defender as the case. Thought it might be too bulky but works just fine for me."
658,5,Great camera and really fast. So many upgraded features from the iPhone 6 I had. Bought the whole family one.
659,5,"I would definitely recommend this phone, great features"
660,5,"We love our IPhones, this was for my son. He loves it no issues."
661,5,Got this IPHONE 8 as an upgrade from my IPHONE 5. Really like the bigger screen and much faster than the 5
662,4,"The IPhone 8 is a good phone. The small size and more GB than my I6s was an attraction to purchase. The phone is very similar to the I6s, except there are two speakers making the sound quality better when using the “loudspeaker”. The camera is supposed to be better, but I can’t tell the difference between that and the I6s. I wish it had a portrait photo mode that automatically blurs the background. Androids have portrait mode."
663,5,"I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it! I wish that Apple would not have gotten rid of the 128gb option, but it is what it is."
664,5,I purchased this for my eldest son. He loves it but wish he had gotten the plus.
665,5,I purchased this for my son and he is loving it.The phone seems to do exactly as advertised.
666,5,I love my iPhone 8pmis. Battery life is amazing. iPhone X has much worse battery life. Definitely would recommend to everyone.
667,5,Phone works great. I bought the plus size so that I have a larger screen for better visibility.
668,5,"Phone works great. I bought the black phone,and I love the classy look."
669,5,Awesome phone and camera...I got the 256G memory....
670,5,"Easy to use, great extras. Apple Support made set-up a breeze Fantastic!"
671,5,"Love the size, excellent battery life. Recommend!!"
672,5,"Very easy to navigate on this phone, the pictures turn out great"
673,4,Great phone features camera works great and good pictures.
674,5,"Love the look of this phone, camera takes great pictures"
675,5,This phone does everything. It also has great memory and quality camera.
676,5,I am a loyal iPhone user and this upgrade came as a necessity when my screen cracked and I was eligible for an upgrade anyway (although my wife thinks I did it on purpose). No complaints on this model. I was not sure if I wanted to wait for the X at that time but I am happy with the 8 Plus - the bigger screen was the best thing since I came from a 6 with the smaller screen.
677,5,Love that I did not have a huge change in size of phone. Nice updates from the 6s . Enjoying figuring all the bells and whistles out.
678,5,Went from an iPhone 5s to an 8 plus! Wow - love it
679,5,I recently purchased this phone for my mother and she loves it! I have the iPhone X and the specs on both devices are amazing. Definitely worth the money!
680,5,I love this new iPhone. The larger hard drive on the entry level phone is a great upgrade!
681,4,Phone was for my wife. Nice phone. Good upgrade from 5.
682,5,"Another great phone from Apple. It is fast, clear photos and looks great with the glass back."
683,4,"This phone is a lot larger than the previous models. The camera quality is excellent. However, the battery is starting to loose charge and I need to take it in."
684,5,"Awesome phone, but charging battery is slow, fantastic camera And operates extremely fast"
685,5,The best part of this purchase was the help I received from the employees.
686,5,"the latest phone from Apple is better than its predecessors yet again. faster, easier to use, and everything you would expect from Apple"
687,5,Love it. Had a 6 plus. Skipped 7 and went straight to 8
688,5,Upgraded from 6s+. Worth the upgrade. Home button was weird at first but now I like it even more than the actual button on the 6 and other previous models. Battery lasts quite a while.
689,5,Works great. Happy with my purchase. Got it in space grey.
690,3,"This is the first iPhone I have ever owned. I am normally an android user but I needed a new phone and there was nothing android out that was interesting to me. Pros of the IPhone 8 -the sound is pretty good -the standby time for the battery feels like forever -I really like the fingerprint scanner -Other than the average white front, the glass finish on the back is actually quite luxurious Cons -The battery seems to drain quick when in use -You have to buy all those extra pieces for fast charging -No back button and menu area on the touchscreen like the android -You can’t customize anything other than basic contributions All in all. The IPhone 8 is pretty alright. I’ll probably honestly go back to android unless Apple owes me with the IPhone X 2"
691,5,"The 21 year old female loves it! What else can you expect out of Apple? As for me, it's too large."
692,2,"I just recently got the iPhone 8, went in because of the boho special with att. See no difference in the technology than the 7. As. Matter of fact the speaker volume is horrible and the ringer is low. Would save my money I was you"
693,5,Bought for daughter! She had a 7plus and she love this one although it isn’t the color she preferred!
694,5,The phone quality is good. The photos look great. I’m glad I upgraded.
695,5,I love my new Iphone 8+ is fast and still has the home button I'd be lost without it. The speakers are great i don't need to use a bluetooth speaker most of the time. I really like the portrait feature.
696,5,Apple update killed my battery on my 6s Plus. Upgraded to 8 plus and its worth the investment.
697,5,Love this new phone and love the new look of this phone 8
698,5,My 4th iPhone. Love it!! I really like the bigger screen if the 8 plus. Even fits in my old case. Would recommend
699,5,The salesperson was very knowledgeable & helpful..
700,4,"Slightly faster, more storage ,better battery life miss seoerate head phone jack"
701,5,Switching from a iPhone 6plus to a iPhone 8 Plus was a great choice. It the size of the phones are similar the camera is awesome!!
702,5,Really elegant looking phone. Impressive. Got it as present for wife.
703,4,I got this phone for my wife. Its the iPhone 8... what else do i have to say. The specs have been virtually the same for the last 3 iPhones. So there is nothing really special about this one. Its nice and sleek like most Apple products. Best Buy had $100 so I decided it was the best deal at the time. But the box came unsealed so I took off one star for that!
704,5,"My first iPhone since the 3GS. I got away from them awhile, but now I'm back for good!"
705,5,"The BulletShield material on the exterior offers impact protection in falls up to 6.6 feet, and its thin and lightweight profile doesn't add extra bulk. This Tech21 case resists yellowing and has a scratch-resistant finish."
706,5,It’s an iPhone 8 what’s not to love. It can fit into iPhone 8 cases which makes it so convenient!
707,5,The size and function of the iPhone 8 Plus is extremely good
708,5,"Love my new iPhone ! It works perfectly. Has a fantastic battery life, great camera, and tons of memory."
709,4,"I love the new camera, and how clear the new screen is. I would recommend this phone to everyone."
710,5,Love my iPhone 8. Definitely recommended to friends and family.
711,4,My boys are the I Phone users and they're always trying to convince me that I should switch from Android. I have to admit iPhone seems to be very simple to navigate. It may be that they convince me at some point to change from Android.
712,5,"Love this phone....went from android to iphone, glad i did."
713,5,Love the sleek design and easy use of the phone. The camera upgrade is excellent and takes amazing pictures with ease!
714,5,Love love love love this phone...very easy to use!
715,5,"It does what it’s supposed to do and I like it, I’d buy it again"
716,5,What more do you expect? It’s a great phone and does what I expect it to.
717,4,I like the 8. It’s light and fast. I am not a huge fan of the glass back. I am still adjusting to some of the features but overall I am enjoying my new phone.
718,4,"while having to upgrade the personnel at the ATT stsore I 240 and S Pe nn OKC need more training in customer service. The clerk Christopher was so far from being in the moment it became strained the longer we conversed the worse it became, the Manager Paul came over and was very distant when explaining the situation which ended the visit with my utter disbelief that they could be so cold toward a 30 year + customer I calmed down and tried the ATT store I 35 and S 19th Moore met Scotty who was very attentive to the conversation and was interested in resolving my issue to my satisfaction. After leaving the store happy Scotty saw I was trying to sync the phone to my car and assisted me with this to completion and made me a very happy person.."
719,5,Upgrade from an iPhone 5s. Great feature and ease of operation.
720,5,Easy to use because it's just like my 7 only faster
721,5,"I was moving from an iPhone 5S to a new phone, and it was so easy! The new iPhone asked me to put the old phone next to it, and they talked to one another! The screen is clear and sharp, the apps respond faster, and the battery life is much improved over my old phone. The fingerprint reader works really well, and the home button has a ""buzz"" feedback to let you know that you've pressed it. Very satisfied!"
722,2,The battery in mine is terrible. It dies very quickly
723,5,I recently upgraded from a 6 to the iPhone 8. So far so good. The camera on the 8 is awesome. I haven’t tried the wireless charging yet. Battery life seems longer on this phone then all previous.
724,5,Love the I phone 8. Camera is way better and love the thinness of it compared to my older iPhone!!!
725,3,"My iPhone 6 went berserk and I had to buy a new phone. In the interim, I used my husband’s iPhone 7 Plus. I guess I got used to it. This iPhone 8 256 is so small and heavy. I wish I would’ve bought the 8 Plus."
726,4,"The phone is fine however, I do miss some of my Samsung features. I have to download an app for some of those features to work☹. I do have to say I love the camera though"
727,2,"I received my phone a week ago. From the moment I turned it on it needed to update... Fine! I updated the phone. It took forever!!! Now I’m having issues with the battery overheating, apps freezing and shutting off. Normally it takes a couple of years for these issues to appear. But Apple needs to get there issues straight. Disappointed in Apple!!!"
728,5,"I received my new iPhone 8 as a Christmas present from my husband. My old iPhone was a 5S. I have used it for many years with no problems until the face screen tried to fall off. My son super-glued it back on! It was only 16GB and I was always having to delete pictures and messages to save space. Now this new phone is faster, louder and has much more space! No more deleting things to make room! Love it!"
729,3,"I have been with AT&T for a long time.... and they usually will give me all options specially now that the phones are no longer free. At the time I needed a new phone because my battery keeps on dying..... I know this is all the Apple software updates.... but, they had a special offer at AT&T to get one iPhone and get the other free.... well, let’s just say.... I did not get the second phone."
730,5,Easy to use and great 12mp pixal camera
731,5,I love the 12mp camera on the new IPhone 8
732,5,Learning new things on it each time I use it
733,5,I love how it is easy to work
734,4,"The battery seems to last a lot longer than my previous iPhone. It has some added features that make it more user friendly but also has a few quirks that to me are a little annoying. The annoying quirk, which if it keeps up I will be going back to ATT to see if something is wrong with it or if I'm doing something wrong, is that I have had to delete my finger print access twice and redo it to get into my phone without using the code. Other than that my wife and I really like our iPhones."
735,1,I upgraded from the 7 and it’s still No one can hear me the phone crackels. Can I get a iPhone that people can hear me with out out saying hello hwllo
736,5,Much faster speed and longer battery life.
737,4,Have had IPhones for years and they keep getting better.
738,1,Horrible phone. Don’t buy it
739,5,"Easy to use, great looking display."
740,5,Was due for an upgrade glad I got my new phone
741,5,Much quicker than old iPhone 6. Smother running and faster operation. ‘Home’ button has a completely different feel. That takes a bit of getting used to.
742,4,"It's good, but not a whole lot different than the IPhone 6."
743,5,"Love the phone! This was a BOGO to a iPhone X , my son loves it."
744,5,I really enjoy my New I phone8....so much faster and does a lot more than my old phone. But customer service was absolutely terrible....no one could activate my phone and I had to go to Tuscaloosa to the AT&T’s store to get activated....jasmine was absolutely wonderful and got me activated in a few minutes....give her a pay raise bc she solved my problem and 3 customer service reps and 2 hours on phone NEVER gott an answer
745,1,It’s just like IPhone 7. The only reason I got it because it was free.
746,5,"I went from 5SE to 8 and really like the differences....display, camera, battery life, etc."
747,3,"Upgraded from the iPhone 6s to the 8. I have not noticed a difference in speed between the two phones. In fact this is my second iPhone 8 in two months since the first one was having issues. Also this screen scratches easily. Apple says one of there most scratch resistance screens. I have never put a screen protector on any of my iPhone and I have never had scratches. The phone is in my side pocket of my purse, my back pocket, or on my desk. The first iPhone 8 scratched within the first few weeks. My replacement scratched quickly also. I see YouTube videos of people trying to scratch the screen and not being successful so I have no idea how these two phones have scratched. Not impressed. Will put a screen protector on now, but should we have to keep buying accessories to protect our phones? My 2 cents."
748,5,Really nice phone. Feels perfect in my hand. It's very fast. Takes excellent photos and video. Battery lasts very long time. Put a minimalist cover on it and a tempered glass screen protector - didn't change the feel of the phone. Love iOS. Another great Apple product!
749,5,I always had Samsumg phones until I got my new IPhone8 and I love it ! The camera is great and it is so easy to work with. The battery lasts for few days. I am very happy with my choice.
750,5,I wasnt sure Id like my phone. But I love it and its easy to use.
751,4,The pictures are great! The iPhone 8 is awesome!! My Apple Music did not transfer over to my new phone but that was my only issue
752,2,Just like all the others some improvements harder to use over complicated the finger touch
753,2,"I just have this phone last December, I had encountered a lot of problems, one being is the screen freezes not responsive to touch with a pop up window that says select wireless, I can’t even hard reboot it. I waited for awhile and I was gonna take it back to ATT, but it disappeared after falling."
754,5,"I just love, love, love this new phone. The battery life is great. You just follow the app steps and you are all set. I think it took me 5 to 10 minutes to set up my new phone. The camera is great. Works well with the third generation apple/watch phone. I would recommend getting a case sooner than later. The phone is a bit slippery. Other than than no issues. Music is great through the headphones. Everything is so quick and speedy. Amazing phone. I have the plus which is kind of like having a mini tablet. Just all around great."
755,5,"This was a big improvement from my last iPhone. From a 5s to an 8 was great. The color available at the time, not so great."
756,5,"Quite simply, a great phone."
757,5,There nor much to say other than my girl is very happy about this Christmas present.
758,5,I absolutely love my new purchase
759,1,Totally disappointed in the phone. I have had trouble with service from day one. My iPhone 4 was much better!
760,5,This is the first IPhone I have owned. It takes some getting used to but so far I like it
761,3,A little buggie. I’m updated with the latest SW updates but there are still some bugs. I want my version 5 back.
762,4,Only difference I see at all is the 64g storage in the 8 compared to the 6S. Kind of wish I would of just gone to the iPhoneX. I thought the 8 had the portrait mode but nope only the plus.
763,5,"Photo great, much clearer than other iPhone"
764,3,"I thought I would love my new iPhone 8 Plus but it freezes quite a bit. My 6 Plus was much better. Also, AT&T really doesn’t offer upgrades, you pay full price for phone and get stuck with another contract with them."
765,5,Upgraded to the iPhone 8 from Samsung S5. No comparison! Outstanding phone! Outstanding value.
766,4,"I just recently got this phone, but so far so good! I haven’t had a problem with it and it seems to work great! Super happy about the extra storage also"
767,2,I'm sending it back. Just too expensive.
768,5,This is my 6th iPhone and from my perspective the best I have owned yet. Super fast and now with wireless charging.
769,5,"Really nice phone, camera is awesome!"
770,4,Great phone so far! Only negative is no 3.5 auxiliary cable input. You have to use the stupid lightning cable
771,5,I love the iPhone 8! It is the best yet. Battery life lasts much longer and the screen is super clear.
772,1,"I have been an IPhone user since day one, this will be my last. The phone is not user friendly at all and Transfer medium has gotten to the point that if you didn't buy it from them, you can't transfer it over from a previous phone. All ring tones sound the same and are made for kids, the phone is outrageously expensive and I relate to an automobile that when you need an oil change, you buy a new car unlike many of the other brands out there that can update and accessorize easier. I waited at the store for 3 hours only to be told that my texts, pictures, self added music and ringtones could not be transferred and that the newer tranfering medium does not allow that, everything on the new one cost $$. In addition during working out details my account has now changed without my authorization to a different plan. Phone also keeps pestering you and trying to trick you into 2 factor authentification and once you do it, you need to change you passwords to get rid of it although you didn't want it in the first place. Well now I know better for next time!"
773,1,you will only post positive reviews so why ask for them. Stop emailing me
774,2,This phone is basically the same as the 6 version. I had no issues with the 6 except the battery life so I got the 8. Now I cant connect to Blue tooth in my car or my blue tooth ear phones. Should have just replaced the battery in my 6. And this phone is way over priced!!! May try a Samsung next time!!
775,1,Two days after upgrading from iPhone 6 I learn that it is true that Apple slowed my phone. I believe they did this to frustrate me into paying for an expensive upgrade. I would have switched to Samsung if I had known this. Next time...
776,5,It’s a Christmas gift for my daughter but I have the 8+ and I love everything about it. I’m quite sure she will love it because she moving up from a 6s to an 8.
777,4,I really like the phone. Really not all that different from the 6 but a lot more upgrades.
778,3,I bought the phone because they had a buy 1 get 1 offer and I needed a phone because I was having storage issues with my old phone and the only way to solve it was to get a new phone. When at the store we were told we would have to get a new number to buy 1 get 1. Not what I had been told a week earlier in the store. Have not seen much difference from my old I phone. Buts it's only been a week.
779,3,"The phone is very nice, but depending on what you are using right now, it may not be worth the upgrade. Comparing the 8 to the 6 that I have, there are definite improvements in the fingerprint access, the camera, and the speed. But these are incremental, and you really have to decide if a second here and there is worth it. Looking at actual printed pictures from both phones, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. They both are more than acceptable to me. Yes, the 8 has more features, but again, are they worth it to you? Sitting the 2 phones side by side, you really can't tell the difference, especial;;y since I have the same case on both. My suggestion is that going from a 6 to the 8, probably makes sense. However, if you have a 6S, or a 7, (the 8 is actually a 7S), I would probably hold off a year and see what direction Apple takes with the X. I don't like facial recognition, so I'll probably stick with the 8."
780,5,It is easy to use. Camera is better. Similar to my Apple IPhone 7
781,5,Great upgrade for my boys! Early Christmas present!
782,3,"I liked the phone immediately, having never had an Apple phone before. But I was not careful about the password- thinking my fingerprint was good as an entrance into the phone- don't do it with gummy fingers!! Now I have to get my phone factory re-set- in a few days. Blah The people at the AT and T store were great"
783,5,Went from a 6 to the 8 and love it!
784,3,Apple has a monopoly on apps. Tired of the updates and other nonsense Apple lures you into. I miss the 3mm headphone outlet (only uses lightning cord).
785,1,There is no real difference than the 6 except the camera If your phone is running well save your money. Apple keeps putting out the same phone. Innovation: a big fat 0. Steve Jobs is probably trying to dig himself out of his grave. Samsung is miles ahead of the game in comparison.
786,5,"The screen is off the chart, amazing HD, new features continue to improve on ease of use and the integration between devices and your technology world is what sets apple apart."
787,5,Love this phone. Glad I decided to go with the smaller phone! Perfect fit.
788,2,Too expensive too justify the buy will be returning
789,2,New iPhone is no upgrade. Same phone as the one I had and don’t even get group texts until the next morning. Apple disappointed me for the first time and I am thinking what to get now that apple has gone down hill
790,4,"I went from a 5S to the 8 and like the size and weight. Photos are much better as is storage. I love that almost everything else is the same, short learning curve!"
791,5,My son got one for his birthday and he loves it!
792,5,"I don’t upgrade every thirty minutes, so to get me to change phones, it has to be great. The IPhone 8 is great! I like that when I pick it up it comes on and is ready to log on, the battery doesn’t have to be charged as often which I REALLY like, and the picture quality is grand."
793,5,"Awesome device, no is comparable with."
794,5,Love the iPhone 8. The size is perfect and I love the rose gold color Finally the screen and display is great. Picture quality is very good
795,3,"There is no face id ,or iris which is more convenient"
796,5,Everything looks great and so good
797,5,Aweosmenesss.. the iPhone 8 is great..
798,5,It was a surprise early Christmas gifts for them and they love it. They likes the features when they grab the phone and it’s turn on the screen without touching any buttons.
799,1,"I’m very disappointed in my phone function so far, it has randomly paused and been inaccessible, I got this phone 2 days ago"
800,4,Overall I am enjoying the iPhone 8 It is much faster then my old iPhone 5s The only thing I do t care for about it is the home button is not as responsive as I would like When you double click on it to close apps Siri answers most times but other wise works well so far
801,5,"Nice phone, nice size, good screen quality, easy to use."
802,5,"I had an iPhone 5 and it was freezing up and running very low on battery all the time. I received some gift cards and my husband and I started shopping on line. I couldn’t decide if I wanted 8 or 8+ so we called the store, made a reservation and 1 hour later we were done. The rep warned me that updates would occur throughout the day and they caused my phone to freeze. But I called back and went in and he showed me how to unlock it. That was it. I keep saying why did I wait so long and for me it was the price. But the gift cards helped and I didn’t want to add to my monthly bill so I paid the balance in full."
803,1,"I bought the IPhone 8 because I've been an IPhone user for 7 years and I didn't want to go through the hassle of transferring all my stuff over to an android device and the 8 has a better performance rating than the Samsung. Now, because the IPhone 8 does not have an earphone jack, I need to either get a special adapter to be able to charge the phone and to listen to music, or I need to buy wireless earphones. Further, I've had trouble with the charging port on the phone. I had to replace my IPhone 6 2 years ago because the charging port would no longer work (the connection got very loose). I bought the 8 just recently to replace the replacement 6 because it had the same problem. The 8 has the same port and now it will be used for both charging AND earphones. Double duty. Hope the engineers fixed the problem."
804,5,I did some research and selected the IPhone 8 while selecting ATT. Hoped it was what I needed. I have had it a couple weeks and checked scads f reviews and tip items on UTube. This is a dynamite phone and ATT is proving to provide very good service and I have some features my previous carrier did not have. Extremely satisfied and customer service at store was equally great.
805,4,"So I have only had the phone for little less then a week, and all together it’s a nice phone, it doesn’t seem as fast as my 7 was but then again I’m big into electronics and anything of that sort, I wish there was more options that came with the 8, like new ringtones, possible backgrounds for messages, backgrounds for your main and lock screens, but I was going to get the 10 and started reading a lot of bad things going on with the 10 so I went to the 8"
806,5,I am very happy with my purchase. A product I have always trusted.
807,3,My daughter is digging the phone more than me. I really do not see much difference from the other IPhones.
808,4,"I love the 8 IPhone 8. It’s similar to the 6 which I had but it’s a lot more sleek. And I love all the extra memory. The only thing is, and I’m sure a lot of people already know, but if you don’t, when I was chatting with a rep at AT&T, I inquired about portrait mode on the 8 and the X. The rep told me both phones had it. I even googled it and it said both phones have it. Only the 8 PLUS has the portrait mode."
809,5,Works excellent and using it is a lot better. Great Iphone
810,4,"I was kind surprise when I push the home button that you can feel the vibration just beneath the home button. I know that its the fastest processor that Iphone ever built. For a fact, the processor does the vibra. It is new to me, I know it could be avoided if R and D made some more research, to make it smooth and vibration free. That is why its only 4 out 5. This is my first upgrade since Iphone 4."
811,5,I had an iPhone 6s before this that I really enjoyed but my wife needed an upgrade so she got my 6S and I got the 8. I love the looks and the speed is just incomparable. I had a wireless charging case on the 6s and the built in wireless on the 8 is much better. I use a wallet case and it works very well and wireless charging is awesome. Battery life is way better too.
812,5,"Apple!, as always, remains the icon of style elegance performance prestige and iPhone 8 is stand much stronger in these aspects and more."
813,4,I just couldn’t live without it... but it’s an iPhone... the same iPhone I have been getting since iPhone 5... oh but the back is glass and I like the color... it’s another iPhone...
814,5,I feel so grateful to get this new phone. Nice and very sassy!
815,5,Nice thin smallish phone easy to carry in front pocket when you don’t have a jacket on.
816,5,Very happy with smaller phone I do wish I would have had the rep sync it to my car difficult for me
817,3,Great phone only downside is battery life is very poor.
818,5,"Love this phone so far. No issues to date, hope it stays this way."
819,5,^^^ Please see title ^^^^
820,3,"I had an android and couldn’t wait to get back to the iPhone. But I am disappointed I can’t see my voice mail because it has a constant blurr and my text messages won’t sync with my new Infiniti, voice to text rarely works. This phone is only 2 weeks old and I must take it back"
821,1,"AT&T wants us to write a positive review not mentioning cost, etc. It is an issue, however. The iPhone 8 is way too expensive. If I had it to do over again I'd keep my old iPhone 6."
822,5,"Love the phone, works fast and easy to use."
823,4,"It’s an upgrade from my iPhone 6. Display looks better. Improvements include better front and back cameras, waterproof, True Tone display, Live Photo, haptic touch, increased processing speed, wireless charging, and awesome battery life. I like this size over the plus models."
824,4,Still getting used to it but seem to like it
825,5,"Upgraded from 6 plus. Things work much smoother, faster, and responsiveness is improved. The truck and press screen thing (whatever it’s called) is way easier to use than the 7 plus I have for work."
826,5,I finally gave in and upgraded from my iPhone 4 to the iPhone 8. What a difference! I love my iPhone 8. I can use my phone all day without having to charge my iPhone. The camera is awesome and takes great pictures. Not only did I upgrade to the iPhone 8 but my husband and our 3 kids also upgraded from their iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8. So far worth every penny.
827,5,"Love it , great quality and better sound."
828,5,This is a very nice smartphone. It was easily set up and ready to go with no problems. Much faster when using the apps and better battery life than our old iPhone 6.
829,5,Love my iPhone. Makes my life so much easier and easy to use.
830,5,Comfortable and soft and not bigger than my face.
831,5,"Upgraded to an iPhone 8 after my 6s plus recently died. I went for the smaller size with no regrets and the performance difference is noticeable. I was considering the X, but opted for the 256GB which costs significantly less. Some are critical of the perceived 'aged' design of the iPhone 8. I compare it to the longevity of the Porsche 911 design, which hasn't required significant changes in decades. What counts is under the hood. And I still like my home button."
832,4,Much speedier and more reliable than the Queen waking up on time.
833,5,"I had had my old iphone 5 for 3 years and am so pleased with the ipone 8. For my use, it is great."
834,4,Basically the seven with faster processor
835,1,Please don't buy. it is not worth to pay the price tag. over priced and not a productive upgrade...
836,3,"Step down from the iPhone 6s, My iPhone 6s battery went bad, so I had to get a new phone. It’s seem to have the same dimensions as my old phone. The no headphone port is kind of a hassle, and it being made completely Made of glass front and back, can make it hard to keep a hold of. I recommend buying a case. Punk cases has them for cheap. No real difference in software on the iPhone eight"
837,5,I recently had the iPhone 6. I like the 8 because it is small as the 6 and still works with the updates since it is a brand new phone. Love that it is gold. Takes Live Photos. Works perfectly!
838,3,The phone is very nice. Not much change to make it worth the price to upgrade from an iPhone 6S
839,5,I purchased my IPhone 8 a week ago and I love it so far.
840,5,My 5s was starting to show its age. Really like my iPhone 8.
841,4,"Recently bought iPhone 8, and gave my iPhone 7 to my son. Although it’s an incremental upgrade to the iPhone 7, the entry level iPhone 8 has twice as much memory capacity (64GB) than entry level iPhone 7 (32GB). I think the major selling point for me was the wireless charging capability. However, I will likely wait until next year when Apple releases its wireless charging device to purchase one. Overall, I’m pleased with the iPhone 8. It’s worth the money spent."
842,2,"So I made a giant jump in technology. I went from my iPhone 5, to an 8 because it was a ""BOGO"" with new service at the AT&T store. I don't care for the product overall and here is a list of my gripes. I don't like the new headphones/loss of the old jack; the phone doesn't interface with my Honda via bluetooth in the same way; the microphone dictation isn't as accurate, and doesn't flip back to the keyboard automatically to make corrections the way it used to. And you have to be more careful with the phone in general because of the glass covering everything. The guy at the store warned me that one good scratch on the camera side glass & it'll be on every photo you take!"
843,5,Best phone ever I got it for me n it the best
844,5,"I recently upgraded my phone from an iPhone 6S to the 8... I absolutely love it! The quality of the pictures are so much better! When I upgrade to whichever iPhone they have in two years, maybe the 10 or something, I know they’ll find a way to make the picture quality even better... I just don’t know how they will do it! It’s a much better version than the 6S was and I liked my 6S #appleforlife Oh and I almost forgot!! The battery life is SO much better... SOOOO much better than the 6S!!!"
845,4,"I’m an Android user but AT&T was having a special, BOGO if you add a new line. The phone is great. I’m used to a little bigger phone so the iPhone 8 plus would probably be better. Vin at the AT&T in Waterbury Brass Mall was great. He was nice and explained everything and I added my son. It was his first cell phone with service so it was pretty exciting moment"
846,5,"4K video in 60fps, improved Touch ID, wireless charging. 5 stars all the way!"
847,5,"iPhone 7: 1. Weighs half an ounce less 2. Less expensive 3. Aluminum back does not crack or attract fingerprints iPhone 8: 1. Wireless charging 2. Can charge to 80% in 30 minutes 3. TruTone display auto adjusts it's tinting to match indoor or outdoor lighting 4. Faster processor (7 is already super fast) 5. Louder, stronger speakers (7 already has great speakers) 6. Improved camera (7 already has a great camera) 7. More slo-motion options at 1080p resolution 8. 32 Mb more storage than the 7"
848,4,I find placing the on/off button on the side instead of the top very inconvenient. I am forever turning my sound down as I hold the phone to press that button.
849,1,Had multiple problems with this phone Had to return with in two days kept my 6splus I realy would like to upgrade to X but very expensive Hope to get more ideas about other smartphones Been with ATT over ten years plus. Thanks Mike
850,5,"Really great slim and casual fit as well as the new glass back. Great quality and speed, really recommend this phone."
851,1,"I had the phone for a couple of days before it began freezing on my. I've had the phone for about two weeks now, and it hasn't frozen in 5 days, which is a good thing. It delays recognizing touch on the top of the screen, every once in a while. The camera doesn't take portrait pictures like the 8 Plus does. I can't use the 8 Plus because my hands are too small :("
852,5,I love all the features about this phone. Since my last two phones were I phones and I kept them each 4 years I stayed with Apple. Used the AT&T transfer app to move over my data from my old phone (although it will not work with my wife's new I phone 8).
853,4,It kinda sucked that we was unable to transfer our photos from my wife's Iphone 5s as she wanted to. We tried both the ATT transfer app and the shareit app with no success and the cloud feature is not moving them either.
854,1,It’s the same as the iPhone 6-7 nothing really that different just apple trying to make money not happy
855,2,Not much change for the price. I believe the cell service is worse with the new phone. AT&T is struggling to provide service. Sporadic at best.
856,5,The phone is great and has good features however was never told that the speaker on the phone was crackle sound. Had to spend 2 hrs on my 2 nd trip for them to tell me it’s a known problem and instructions give to fix at home bc the server at ATT would take far long.
857,4,Sound needs to be louder please
858,5,It's ok I'm just getting use to the new features.
859,5,"Upgraded from a 5s and am very happy so far. I love the display, speed and ease to change to a new phone. Purchased in an AT & T store and received excellent service and assistance setting up the new phone."
860,1,Disappointed in battery life. I’m still learning some features but do not like the vibration for inputs. No huge improvement over iPhone 6 that I had.
861,5,I love my new phone. My battery last all day even when I use my phone a lot. I like the camera on this phone better than any other phone I have had in the past. Very user friendly and believe me that is important to me!!
862,5,Love this phone! Fast delivery great service
863,4,"The phone is ok,but there are 3 colors to choose from. I ordered silver and it’s basically white, white a silver rim."
864,5,Fast wireless charging. Long battery
865,2,"I have made an upgrade from 4S to 8+ about two weeks ago and honestly only difference is the speed and screen size! Everything else is the pretty much the same! Pics look about the same and yes there is a portrait option but really who takes those photos anyway? Also fingerprint unlock is new for me but it can be kinda annoying since every time you press your phones home button it opens up. I have looked at the new Samsung note 8 and screen was so so much better and also pics looked way better but I have never had Samsung phone and don’t feel like trying to learn all that new stuff so I just decided on iPhone again more for convince than anything else. IPhone really didn’t change that much at all since I got 4S in 2012. Wish Samsung was little more simple I would got it for sure, but for now this is just ok."
866,5,"As always Apple products are great, but pricey!"
867,5,awesome phone. I like the glass back
868,5,Really love my phone. Lots of updates since my 5s thumbs up!
869,5,"I've only my iPhone 8 for a couple of weeks and coming from an Android based phone I'm still learning to navigate it properly. So far, all is great and everything just works!"
870,5,"This cell has the perfect size, great feature, love the fact that is water resistant and it has such of sleek look. Two thumps up."
871,5,I traded in an iPhone 6 for the 8 att staff was helpful and transferred data from the old iPhone to the new iPhone. Love the new iPhone
872,5,"Overall The phone is beautiful the phone is great there’s no question it’s amazing. The top right of the screen doesn’t work the first time or click to go down on emails, and it still has the same problems that the regular iPhone has. Somethings are always just wishy-washy like my email shows four emails but I do not have any emails right now. The headphones for some reason do not work correctly when on voice applications, they have an intense amount of static."
873,5,I like it speed camera and battery life
874,5,Love the size of the phone and colors and how it fits my hand !
875,4,"I went in wanting an iPhone 8, but not really knowing the difference between the 8 and the 8s. Wish I had known the difference, I would have bought the 8s"
876,5,"I gave it a 5 star because I enjoy my iPhone but between the 7 and 8, there isn’t much difference. Feel little faster and not a fragile and thin. Overall still a great phone."
877,4,"I wish it came with a split connector or wireless headphone set, the pictures are much better than with the 5, 5c and 5s that we had in our plan. I am happy with it. I hope he battery issues we have with the 5’s dying quickly are also solved with this upgrade."
878,5,I would highly recommend it always had an iPhone and love it and it is fast.
879,2,Nice phone but battery does not last
880,5,I'm still learning about my new phone. The little I've used it I'm impressed. So my rating won't be accurate.
881,4,"It seems like a great phone but I haven't had it long enough to learn all the little nuances. It is very similar to my I-5s but some of the little ""bells and whistles"" are a different. If you are ham fisted like myself then I recommend a good case for it because it is very hard to hold on to if you have large hands.."
882,4,It was a nice upgrade from my iphone 5. faster speed and learning all the new updates.
883,5,"I love my phone, I do not like this review"
884,5,The iPhone 8 is the exact same as all the other iPhones they’re great not a whole bunch of difference between the six in the eight
885,4,I live in a dead zone. No matter what service is being used we had to stay in one spot once there were enough bars to talk. Sometimes we’d have to go outside to find service. Now that I have the I phone I don’t have this problem. I’m able to talk in 50% of the house which is an improvement over rarely having service.
886,5,Love my new iphone8. I went in to get the iPhone and they had a great special that worked out me
887,5,I went from the 5s to the 8plus. Big difference in size of course but really notice the sound when I am on the phone. Much clearer now. Although I think the 7plus is jsut as good. I went to the AT&T store asking for the 7plus but only had the same gold color. They had it in Black but a 8plus. Good way up up selling I think? First thing I did was to get the Otterbox. Fits both 7 and 8plus. Pictures are good. I guess I really didn't see the big difference some people say there is. Much faster when charging and battery lasts longer. Bigger screen means more aps on my first page. I do have beats headphones that plug in so I need to sue their adapter which is included. Not a big deal because I only sue them on the plane flights. All in all a good move. The price is a bit steep but I don't plan on upgrading for another few years.
888,5,It’s a typical Apple product. Runs buttery smooth as usual. The battery life seems surprisingly well for the size of it. Had the 7 Plus for a few months before going to the other top competitor. Still having it on a different carrier and the 8 you can’t really go wrong with any of them anymore. I would and do recommend the iPhone 8 to friends family and foes alike!! Bought the gold version this go around more of a cream with a champagne aluminum ring. Wireless charging is a go it works with my Samsung charger with no problems. Mainly bought this for the iMessage to communicate with a few of my friends and family. It’s a Apple you can’t go wrong with it.
889,4,"In comparison to the iPhone 6 which is what I upgraded from, its very different in the feel. I like how you can decide the sensitivity of the home button. The only downfall which very well could be part of an IOS issue is when I get a text message if I don’t look at it it goes away from the home screen after a while."
890,5,Love this phonee got it for my dad and myself most amazing phone I've had
891,4,"I think the iPhone 8 is great, however I don’t feel like it’s that big of an upgrade from the previous versions. It’s very similar to the 7 and 6s, so I don’t understand the huge price increase. But I do like the new Gold color. And the glass back. It’s a very pretty phone!"
892,5,"So far so good, good to be back to apple after an excursion into the dark side. Apple has a great product"
893,5,Love my new iPhone 8. Have had it 2 weeks. Using it now on a Reformation 500 trip in Germany. Takes amazing pics! As Luther and JS Bach would say: Soli Deo Gloria! Pastor Scott S
894,4,I do like that this phone is slightly smaller than my Edge 7 but I am disappointed that it lacks portrait mode on the camera.
895,2,"All voice calls have a static-y, crackling, spark sound in the receiver when someone speaks or when there is any sort of sound on the other end of the call. Have tried contacting AT&T several times and have not received a response. I’ve had my phone less than one week. The battery seems to die quicker than the iPhone 6 I had as well."
896,5,"Love the size, not too big, but nice screen. Picture is super crisp, functionality is still good and fast, camera is great,"
897,5,I love the new phone The customer service was really nice
898,5,Great service and very good product
899,5,"better camera, more games"
900,3,"There is no significant difference between this phone and the past 2 iPhones. If your previous phone is in mint condition, I would recommend keeping what you have or maybe going for the X. I had the 6s and I feel as tho I have bought the exact same phone over again."
901,5,ATT and Apple thanks! Getting new device was easy!
902,5,Happy with the phone. I had an i6 before getting the 8. I was satisfied with the 6 but the 8 has a few more nice features.
903,5,"No joke, iPhone 8 is pretty much identical to the iPhone 7 (they even use the exact same cases) just a bit of an upgrade like wireless charging (which I’ll probavly never use) and from what it seems, better lighting and a slightly better camara. Don’t get me wrong, I like my iPhone 8 (64gb), but you can pretty much get an iPhone 7 with 128gb for about the same price as the iPhone 8. That’s why I recommend, if you have an iPhone 6 and you’re trying to upgrade I’ll say get the 8 if you want the slightly better features, but if you’re looking for space defiantly get the 7. if you already have the iPhone 7, I wouldn’t even bother wasting money, just stick with it. Oh and also the iPhone 8 is a pretty heavy phone because of the glass back! (5 stars because I like my phone, hasn’t failed me yet!)"
904,5,"Love the new iPhone 8...camera takes eye popping photos, but the sharpness of the HD retina display is very breathtaking.. Of course, the speed of the A11 chip is incredible ."
905,5,The phone is very good. Functional & effective
906,5,Great phone! Love the camera! And amazing cellular service from AT&T!
907,4,"Love my phone! Unfortunately Siri and talk texting is horrible! Even if you talk as slow as possible, sucks bad. May as well just type it. Fix Siri, she’s always sucked. Really ruining my new experience with Apple"
908,5,"I went from a 6s to this 8s and I am really pleased. It is faster, has longer battery life, still very easy to use and great picture. Very happy with purchase."
909,5,"Really like this phone. Went from an iPhone 5s and this was a very nice upgrade. Really like the reliability, ease of use and quickness of my new phone."
910,5,What a great phone again from Apple Thanks to Apple for a great product
911,5,Enjoying it so far thank you
912,5,I am new to iPhone from the Note 5 .... so far very similar to the note but much better battery and camera ... overall very happy!
913,1,This phone is junk as everyone has told me After I got two of them
914,3,"Good product, a lot unstable, go for the 8S"
915,1,"I was told the Display on my IPhone 6s was bad, so was talked into upgrading to the IPhone 8. I still get a Blu-ray screen when trying to open my phone icon. You can not even read it. The only thing I can figure is when they transferred my data from the iPhone 6, they transferred the problem with it. That is messed up."
916,5,The phone was great. Battery life is all day which is perfect for someone working long hours. No issues at all
917,5,Love the phone. It is what I expected and more.
918,1,"Apple just keeps getting worse and worse yet somehow more expensive). Glass is super easily scratch/broken. Dropped from less than a foot out of my pocket and onto my coffee table... now it has a huge scratch across the screen. I've dropped older phones from a lot higher up and nothing. Back of the phone scratches just as easily just from taking it in and out of my pocket for 30 minutes I was bale to buy a case for it. Seeing this, I seriously doubt the claims of ""water resistance."" Battery life is somehow worse than previous versions. It charges faster but that doesn't mean you won't be plugging it in multiple times a day. Buttons aren't as responsive."
919,1,"I have had nothing but problems with this phone from the day I received it! When talking on the phone, I am told it fades in and out. People have a really hard time hearing me. I took it back to the store I purchased it at. This was after 4 days. I was told I had to go to an Apple store to resolve the problem. I could not return the defective phone. I am still dealing with this after two weeks."
920,5,So far it works great. Having it delivered to my house was an amazing process!
921,3,"If you ever had a iPhone, this is really nothing new. It's the same phone."
922,5,My iPhone 8 is everything they promised I love it. I would like it just a little bit bigger but not like the plus that is to big to carrier in my pocket.
923,5,"always like getting the new products from apple, and its always been a great experience, also got the newest ipad also. I also have my cell with AT&T and am very pleased with them also!"
924,2,"If you need a phone, then by all means get the latest. But if not, keep your 7. And for some reason, this phone keeps freezing on me. I think I recieved a bad one! I'm not in the best spirits with AT&T at the moment because of their customer service , website and programing issue. But I am a long time customer so I do know the products"
925,5,"Just traded up from iPhone 6 to iPhone 8. Smooth transition when you back up your old phone in iTunes first. Only had one issue and that was with my email. Out of three accounts, only one was working so I had to go back the next day, but it was resolved quickly. If you buy an 8 I would definitely recommend checking to make sure your email is working properly. Everything reloaded great from iTunes."
926,4,Great phone for Apple. The 7 seems to be the exact as an 8 just with wireless charging. If you don’t care about wireless charging just get a 7.
927,5,Purchase of phone was simple but the transfer from one phone to the new one always finds a glitch! The reason for 5 stars - the help all associates provided me when attempting to solve the glitch. The never gave up or looked as if I was a pain.
928,3,I still has the same problems
929,5,"iPhone 8 is a great phone. The updates make it worth purchasing. It holds the charge longer & easier to charge with the charge pad. It’s too bad the that you need a new case because of the camera lenses. Also the small attachment needed to use the ear buds doesn’t fit in the old case. Very easy to lose. Other than that, I like the new phone."
930,4,is better than the i phone 6
931,5,Great great phone! Definitely worth it to upgrade when you have a iPhone 6s
932,5,We will always get the iPhones and we love att so many people talk cheaper routes but we have always felt supported and great about u
933,4,Obviously nice but mines always losing its battery fast and I’m not even on it much. I do want a solid answer if it’s true that the iPhone 8 is water proof without a case.
934,1,It’s the same as the others Nothing exciting
935,5,"I really don't know what the difference between iPhone 7 and 8, but love it."
936,5,"I downsized from the iPhone 6s Plus and am so glad I did. This phone feels way better in my hand. I am also in super happy with true tone, the louder speakers and the wireless charging capability."
937,5,Great camera and operating speed. So glad it’s the same size as my 7 was. Didn’t have to purchase a new case! Hope the battery in this one is better than the 7...
938,5,Great. But new to Apple just takes time
939,5,Great phone so far. Camera and speed is excellent
940,5,Upgraded from 4s. About time I know. Loving the faster speed. Thanks Br!an at Azusa ATt store.
941,4,"iPhone 8 is glass sleek and bigger lens, I appreciate the upgrade in 64G, I also like the way it feels. Im not used to the home button yet, it doesn't click, but I like the driving disable feature, and I'm impressed with my photos and videos. I also like the read feature of voicemail messages."
942,3,I upgraded from 6s to 8. And didn’t feel that much of a difference. Regret my own personal decision... love the service though. Which trade in credit is higher. Was going to 7 but then buy one get one was on the 8....
943,5,"Walked in to the AT&T Park Street Branch - was greeted right away and bought a new iPhone 8. Sales Rep was courtesy, humorous and extremely helpful. Walked out a happy AT&T Customer !!!!"
944,5,"I was hesitant about upgrading from the 7 plus but i did and i am beyond thrilled! the phone is amazingly fast , the camera is insane ,battery on heavy usage lasts all day plus more ( i got 32 hours w extremely heavy usage) chargers faster....and its sexy and classy . I have the space grey which is more like black. I know alot of people are waiting for the X (that just doesnt appeal to me). Get this phone , you wont be disapponted"
945,5,I love the new iphone 8!!
946,5,I love the speed of the device along with the new features such as the do not disturb while driving.
947,5,"Got this phone for my mom, who has the 5s before. She’s ok with technology and this phone was a quick and easy adjustment for her."
948,4,"the only good thing about it is it offers you more space, wireless charging and a better screen."
949,5,"Upgrade from a 5s. I find the size of the 8 is great. The speed is fantastic and the new additions with iOS 11 are fun. If I had it to do again, I would."
950,5,"To anyone who has an iPhone 7 or before, they might want to consider upgrading to the iPhone 8. It's buttery smooth, the battery lasts a long time (throughout the day with ease), the camera is sharp and take clear, bright, and colorful images. Get it."
951,5,Awesome everything was AWESOME
952,4,The is great improvement over the old phones
953,5,"I have had an iPhone for many years and I really like my new iPhone 8. Getting use to not having a button to push has been new, and I like the apps that are pre-installed. Having 256GB of data helps me as I start a business and I never know how much data an app will require. Thanks Apple!"
954,5,I just love the new iPhone 8!!! The camera is a lot better. I like how it lock you out of texting while you are driving.
955,4,"It's an iPhone: works smoothly even with the most demanding of tasks, has a good battery life (can get you through the day if not in super intensive use), AMAZING speakers (which was quite the update) and a great feel of the new button. Would suggest to those updating from iPhone 6. It's not worth if you already have a 7."
956,4,I don’t really see a big difference between the 7 plus and this 8 plus but the camera is more Clearer and the music is a little louder but overall it’s an awesome phone
957,4,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6Plus and am really happy I did. The camera is great and the battery life awesome. I also love the wireless charging feature. Only thing I really wish is that it had a headphone/aux cord jack so I could charge my phone while listening to podcasts/music. Also, the tiny adapter is hard to keep up with. Overall though, very happy with the device."
958,3,"After making the switch from my original iPhone 6, I can only slightly detect a difference in speed when opening apps. The phone does unlock quicker, it does change screens faster, but overall the loading of content to screens is not worth upgrading from a 6. I would have replaced my battery in my 6 had my charging pins not failed. While I am happy with the phone- it simply does not seem to be an improvement."
959,1,"Received as a Christmas present and am very disappointed and unsatisfied. When talking to another person, their is alot of static when the other person speaks or if there is any type of background noise on the other end. (Static/Noise pollution continued even after disabling the Wi-Fi tethering feature). The design, features, storage, camera and battery life ratings are irrelevant if the sound quality is poor and you are unable to talk to someone on the phone. Afterall, isn't that what a phone is for?!"
960,5,Great phone! Love the ease of use of my iPhone 8 and camera is amazing as Apple does a great job of making their phones easy to use and just beautiful to look at!
961,2,"No one warned me that this Phone was set to automatically connect to data any time it judged the wifi was poor, so I was surprised when I started getting text messages about going over my data limit when I thought I was on my home wifi. The only thing that changed was my phone. Wish Verizon had given me a heads-up on this."
962,2,"The phone does have a nice camera and the battery is good, but I have issues with the sound. There is now an additional speaker at the top of the phone that adds to the sound quality but unfortunately it is so powerful that it vibrates the phone. When I'm holding the phone playing music or watching a video, I can feel those vibrations in my hand (even at a low volume). I'm sure the extra speaker was a good idea, but it didn't play out well with the thinner material and glass back. To be honest, I should have replaced the battery on my Iphone6 and skipped the upgrade."
963,5,"Upgraded from the 6S to the 8 last week. Absolutely love it!!! So much faster than my 6S and takes amazing low light photos. This is not a huge upgrade, but is perfect for my needs. Not a huge fan of the Gold color of the 8, it looks more like copper, so I got the silver........gorgeous!!! My husband ended up with my 6S (which is in great working condition) so it was a win win!! I really love my new iPhone 8."
964,5,"I went from a 16GB 6 to an 8 and it is fantastic. I no longer have the signal issues I had with my 6 and have plenty of space. I know everyone’s all about the X but if you aren’t an iPhone fanatic, this is a huge upgrade for anyone using a 5 thru 6s. I hope to have this phone for a long time"
965,2,Basically an iPhone 6 with a different home button. It was ridiculously expensive. Only upgraded because my 6 mysteriously started running like garbage right around the time the new phones were announced. Weird
966,2,"Great phone on paper, but we have two i-phone 8 and both have issues with sound quality during phone conversation. Several times the opposite party does not hear my voice. Also the sound from speaker is cracking or muffled during conversation. Tried working with Apple support and they are replacing the phone. Not sure if this is a hardware or software issue. I updated the software that was supposed to fix this issue, but did not rectify the issue."
967,5,"My 5S was swell and I didn't feel a necessity to change until my photo library began to push storage to the limit. Stepping up to an 8 has been an awesome experience. Maybe if you've had a 6 or 7, an 8 doesn't seem like all that big of a deal to you. I understand. But this is a big deal for me. The larger size is not as cumbersome as I feared it might be. I feel no necessity for something that feels like an iPad mini. This is a great phone and text messaging, web browsing, mobile banking, boarding pass displaying pocket device. It's blazing fast and has awesome battery life."
968,4,Upgrading to the iPhone 8 from the iPhone 6 was a great move! The old phone was showing it's age but the 8 is incredibly smooth. The battery will be around 30 percent on a heavy use day for me. I'd recommend buying a case for the device and the Verizon network makes the experience a lot better.
969,4,"The phone works as you’d expect from an iPhone. Good camera quality, sound, screen pixels and so on. No need to upgrade unless you need the new phone at all costs."
970,1,"More disappointed than ever before... can’t believe I bought this garbage will be returning it ASAP.. I guess if you want a simple outdated basic iPhone this is it. I can’t come up with anything better to say.. I mean your not getting anything new here same old design like iPhone 4s , the iPhones are still buggy and lag alot.... the iPhone still uses and LCD screen which is horrible in sunlight. The front and back glass still crack very easily . come on .... the battery life is ok but was expecting the battery to last a full 10 hours and I only get roughly 6-7 hours.... The price is still too high for what your not getting ... I would definitely look into buying Another device that’s not apple made. I would definitely buy a phone that has high end features . This iPhone is not worth my time and money... If you want the best of the best don’t buy this device at all. Because you’ll regret it big time... not much more I can say at this point . Overall again if you want same old design same old Screen, same old software, same old stuff go for it.. the last thing I’m going to say is the one feature I really like is this It has fast charging.. 0-100 percent in 1 hour and 50 mins , the regular charging takes 0-100 percent in 2 hours and 30 Mins....the only downside to this is that you will have to spend more money to get the usb type C cord and Type C wall adaptor...is it really worth buying the usb type C chargers the answer is yes. But overall would not recommend this iPhone at all.. go with something else that offers more and that offers a better upgrade for your cash........"
971,5,Upgraded from the 6 to the 8 64gb. The battery life seems to be way better and the speed is fantastic and I am enjoying the “live”pictures wireless charging works very well.
972,5,The iPhone 8 is very fast and easy to use. Battery life is excellent and I really like the look and overall design. Call quality is excellent. I have no complaints about this phone at all.
973,1,"The ""gold"" phone just arrived and it's pink. I hate it. So frustrated that it was not advertised accurately. Color choices are silver, pink and black."
974,5,"Got this in gold (256 gb) and I love it. Upgraded from the 6Plus. Transfer was simple and I was able to set the whole thing up myself in less than an hour. My only complaint is I was told if I preordered, I could go into Verizon and trade in my phone to reduce the monthly payment. When I actually went to do it, I was told I could NOT do that, so now I'm stuck with a higher monthly payment than I wanted, and I am NOT happy about that. Ended up using the trade to purchase a birthday gift for my husband, so I guess it's an even trade. I absolutely recommend a good case though, since no matter how durable they claim the glass is, you don't want to take the chance."
975,5,Absolutely the best one yet. I got in gold and love everything about it. I had the 6s which I was happy with but decided to go ahead and get the 8. Very happy I did. Ended up with 4 in the household
976,5,"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus because I wanted a smaller phone with a little more space. I’m not the biggest fan of phablet sized phones personally. Everything on the 8 is super quick as expected, simple, and am loving the new features and glass-design (doesn’t slip out of your hands as easily). Wireless charging is a huge perk for me as well. If you have a 5, 6 or 6s then the 8 is a great upgrade. If you have the 7, don’t waste your money. Overall, it’s an excellent phone."
977,5,"I upgraded from the iPhone 7 128 GB to the the 8 256 GB. So far I am loving iOS 11 and how fast the 8 is compare to the 7. I debated between the 8 and 10, but so far I like the new look of the 8 with the glass body. Overall I am very happy with my iPhone 8."
