0,4,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6Plus and am really happy I did. The camera is great and the battery life awesome. I also love the wireless charging feature. Only thing I really wish is that it had a headphone/aux cord jack so I could charge my phone while listening to podcasts/music. Also, the tiny adapter is hard to keep up with. Overall though, very happy with the device."

6,4,I mean it’s a great phone but I kind of regret not just going for the X getting the 8 Plus was a step backwards

8,5,I needed a new cell phone and this was a great choice.
9,5,I upgraded from a IPhone 6S. Larger screen is great. A few more features.

17,5,Great customer service when purchasing the phone. The phone is excellent.
18,5,Purchased for girlfriend. A very cool phone. She likes it.
19,4,I bought this for my son and he loves it. I am an Android guy but this is a nice phone.
20,5,I like the phone but it’s to expensive to buy for a teenager let them take the used and we upgrade as adults!
21,5,This is basically the same phone as IPhone 7 Plus. A little faster processor and a little better camera but that’s it.
22,5,Went from a 6 plus to a 8 plus! Love the pictures!! Happy with my decision
23,4,My daughter was so excited to get this phone. She says the camera takes great pictures.
24,5,This new 8 plus iphone is awesome. I love the big screen and the updated camera
25,5,I have only had my iphone 8 plus for a few weeks but I am in love with the large screen and awesome camera. I have no complaints.
26,5,It’s an iPhone. Display is exceptional especially on the plus. New camera and lighting are worth the upgrade
27,5,Love the huge screen and amazing cameras. Touch screen is awesomely responsive

32,5,Got it for my oldest kid as a gift it went over well
33,4,I upgraded to the new iPhone 8 and love it so far.
34,5,IPhone 8 has fast processor and fun to have. I think this is a better deal than the X. If you don’t need the features in X. It’s $300 less than the X with enough features that you may not need in X. It’s not much of an upgrade from iPhone 7. But huge jump if you have iPhone 5
35,5,The I phone 8 is a pleasure to use. The camera takes beautiful pictures.
36,5,"Phone is excellent, camera is first rate. Easy to use and a good size."
37,5,"Since Apple decided to bypass the regular ""s"" models of their phones in favor of a new number, the iPhone 8 is basically what the iPhone 7s would have been. An upgrade to the hardware, but the same external size and components. Either way, the iPhone 8 is a great phone and is faster than the 7 and boasts a better battery life than its predecessor as well."
38,5,This phone is awesome the screen size is perfect battery life seems good
39,4,I can’t say I’m impressed by this. People rave about the camera but I feel like my iPhone 6 did a better job
40,5,My whole family has only used iPhones since they started coming out. Wouldn’t use anything else
41,5,"Since Apple decided to bypass the regular ""s"" models of their phones in favor of a new number, the iPhone 8 Plus is basically what the iPhone 7s Plus would have been. An upgrade to the hardware, but the same external size and components. Either way, the iPhone 8 Plus is a great phone and is faster than the 7 Plus and boasts the best battery of the iPhone lineup!"
42,4,If you really can’t get past the X not having a home button the 8 builds on the current design of the iPhone that has been around since the 6 was released. Wireless charging is finally here for the iPhone.
43,5,"Phone battery life is amazing, last two plus days and is good for how much I use my phone. Good phone for the price."
44,5,I had a lot of problems and this was a God send and all my problems were solved.
45,5,"So far, I love the new iPhone. It's faster, has a better camera and is still as easy to use as past models."
46,5,Big upgrade from my iPhone 6. The added memory helps on downloaded mudic
47,5,Went with the I Phone 8 instead of the 10 because that's what my daughter wanted. She loves it!
48,5,"I replaced my iPhone 6s Plus with an iPhone 8 Plus. The battery in my 6s Plus was deteriorating & rather than replace the battery I decided to upgrade to an 8 Plus. The battery lasts much longer & I really like the processor speed & the wireless charger capability. Also, I was able to get a pretty decent trade-in value for my 6s Plus."
49,5,Great phone. Perfect size for what I need to do and is great for movies. Camera is amazing
50,5,Bought the 8 Plus for my teenage son. He loves the larger screen size since he watches some YOU TUBE videos. Highly recommend 8 PLUS
51,5,"Upgraded from iPhone 6. I love the bigger size, better camera and more storage!"
52,5,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she has not put it down since."
53,5,Upgraded from iPhone 6. Wasn’t sure I was going to like the bigger size but now I don’t think I can go back!
54,5,I absolutely love my new 8 Plus. I had a 6 Plus and the camera quit working and decreased speaking quality. iPhone is the Best
55,5,"Staff was very helpful, knowledgeable and made time for me."
56,5,I’ve always had the smaller iPhones but i went with the plus and the Big screen is wonderful and great camera!
57,5,I get this phone for my daughter for Xmas and she’ll loved it. It’s really nice features and she’s really happy.
58,5,Upgrade phone works great for now. Best Buy set up phone with cell carrier .
59,5,The phone has worked great so far. Does everything I need. I use it for work as well. Nice screen size and takes wonderful pictures
60,5,I’ve been wanting to get it but I’m just hesitant to get coz it’s a new model of iPhone. I’m happy with it.
61,3,Had to purchase a new phone after the battery of the 6 stopped holding the charge
62,5,This phone is same as iPhone 6 and 7. Can’t tell the difference unless your really into spec from details.
63,5,"Great phone for me , not as fancy as the 10 but great for my use"
64,4,Same as above. Best Buy employee was extremely helpful and knowledgeable
65,3,"Fast and very durable but 8 iPhone does not have portrait mode, something to think about"
66,3,Pretty much the same thing apple’s had for years. Nothing new or that great.
67,5,Like the new 8. Kinda the same as my 7 but works better.
68,4,"I almost love this phone. It's is extremely responsive, and much faster than the 6s I had. The battery life for me (not a heavy user), is quite nice, lasting at least 36 hours before recharging. My only complaint is that it is wider than I expected, and I can no longer text with one hand, even with the split keyboard."
69,5,"Decided not to wait for battery replacement on my iPhone 6 and just upgrade to the 8. It's basically the same phone with a better camera and force touch, plus all the other new bells and whistles. I debated on getting the X but wasn't that impressed with face id and I'd have missed the home button too much. My first iPhone was the 4 and lasted me until the 6 came out and now I got the 8, which is better longevity than any of the android phones we've had. Battery lasts super long now which is great, camera is nice, the gold is pretty. New (to me) home button takes some getting used to, specifically that touch id so so super fast now that it takes me to my home screen when I really just wanted to quick check my notifications on my lock screen or swipe to take a photo. I need to get used to just picking it up and tilting it instead."
70,5,"this is my first foray into the PLUS size iPhone. at first I thought it would be bulky. but no, it fits well in my pockets and the screen is awesome!!!!"
71,5,"love the new iphone, great phone, awesome camera. Love it"
72,5,"I love my I-phone 8 plus. It is big enough to see, but not too big to hols. Pictures are great. It was not a hard adjustment from my 6. It did take a second to get use to the button pressure. I also added an app that tkes me to the home page."
73,5,"I bought this phone last week, it’s a very good phone, fast, more features than my previous phone, I recommend this Phone"
74,5,Always happy with Apple phones. My only suggestion would be for the salesperson to share a brief summary/highlights of what the new phone version brings.
75,5,Phone is great but it sucks Apple makes you buy a new phone every 2 years
76,5,My wife loves this phone but we are disappointed with Apple making u buy a phone every 2 years
77,4,"Phone has everything I need, making the X an unnecessary waste of extra money. Get the 8 plus"
78,4,"Phone purchase suggested by our son, who has used iPhones for years. Learning transition from years of android use. Not finding degree symbol on keypad."
79,5,I love my new phone. The sales associate was helpful in familiarizing me with it. It's much faster and easier to use than my old phone.
80,5,Great phone really recommend this phone to everybody!!!!
81,5,We've always had Android phones but the kids wanted Apple phones because they use Aplle computers in school. We'll see if the phones bring the grades up
82,5,Great camera and the bigger size works well for me!
83,5,"I was OK with the price, but I love the phone. They did not have a big selection of colors but I was OK with that."
84,5,I'm glad I went with the 8 plus instead of the X. My cousin did research and the 8 plus is much better than the X and less frustrating.
85,5,"Love the iphone, having all my content synced between devices streamlines activities."
86,5,Great phone for price. Nice large display! My girls love it!
87,5,"We love our IPhone 8+. Great sound for movie, video watching, love the new camera"
88,5,Bought the phone for my Child. Love all of the great Parental controls.
89,5,I love the new camera. Apple makes the best phones with best service.
90,5,Love the IPhone 8 Plus. I have always owned Apple products. Love the quality and ease of use.
91,4,"The phone is fine however, I do miss some of my Samsung features. I have to download an app for some of those features to work☹. I do have to say I love the camera though"
92,2,"I received my phone a week ago. From the moment I turned it on it needed to update... Fine! I updated the phone. It took forever!!! Now I’m having issues with the battery overheating, apps freezing and shutting off. Normally it takes a couple of years for these issues to appear. But Apple needs to get there issues straight. Disappointed in Apple!!!"
93,5,"I received my new iPhone 8 as a Christmas present from my husband. My old iPhone was a 5S. I have used it for many years with no problems until the face screen tried to fall off. My son super-glued it back on! It was only 16GB and I was always having to delete pictures and messages to save space. Now this new phone is faster, louder and has much more space! No more deleting things to make room! Love it!"
94,5,"I came from a 5 so it’s a big step up a lot faster and more features. I don’t think the reception is any better for calls. I set it up with iCloud and was easy. If you have Apple Music make sure you have playlists turned on in the library home screen. That setting didn’t seem to transfer from backup. Verizon was a pain, I had to call 800 automated line to activate. The information was right online but just would not take."
95,5,"My daughter's iPhone 5S began having numerous problems, therefore, I had to upgrade. Best Buy had a better deal on the iPhone 8 which overall will save me money. I had planned to get her the iPhone 7 but for a few dollars more we were able to get 256GB which is best for my daughter! Audrey and Karl were AWESOME knowing I had limited time, they worked as a team and had me in and out with time to spare! Great service and wonderful to see how professional they were working together!"
96,3,"I have been with AT&T for a long time.... and they usually will give me all options specially now that the phones are no longer free. At the time I needed a new phone because my battery keeps on dying..... I know this is all the Apple software updates.... but, they had a special offer at AT&T to get one iPhone and get the other free.... well, let’s just say.... I did not get the second phone."
97,5,"The iPhone 8 is awesome. It is fast, responsive, and easy to both set up and use. I upgraded from an iPhone 6, and the differences are monumental."
98,5,Love my new phone! Takes great pictures and video!
99,5,Easy to use and great 12mp pixal camera
100,5,I love the 12mp camera on the new IPhone 8
101,4,She loves the phone and the ease of use between all her apple products. She can text like lightening!
102,4,"I bought this phone to replace my mom's old laggy iPhone 6+. She likes it and she easily learned all the new features quickly. Thank you Best Buy for setting up her new phone for her before she left the store. My mom is having a minor issue with her new phone. When she is in a low signal area or overly congested area, call quality sounds terrible on the person she called side.The call comes in clear on her end, but on the other end the call quality is very muffled, staticky, and has an echoing effect. I don't know if this a Apple issue or Verizon issue. According to her, Its only happened a few times over a course of a month. Besides that issue, she likes the phone a lot over her old iPhone."
103,5,"The iPhone X gets all the love (justifiably so) but this is is a great upgrade from previous models Fast great screen and camera, great speakers and battery life. Powerhouse"
104,5,"It was a gift for my daughter, and she loved it. She said it was so easy to use it!!"
105,4,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6s and there really isn’t much new to this one. It has the wireless charging capability, which is cool, but everything else is essentially the same. That’s not a bad thing since the 6s was very good but there aren’t really enough improvements to make it worth the upgrade u less you are having issues with your current phone and need something new. It’s a great phone though."
106,5,"Overall the phone is great, faster than my last IPhone, better screen, better pictures."
107,5,Bought for my son for Christmas as a replacement for his Apple IPhone 6. He is very happy with the phone and always has Apple iPhones now. No other is considered.
108,5,Lovely phone. good memory. Camera is great. Great service picking up from local Waitrose
109,5,Phone fits perfect. Screens seemlesly transition. The pictures are perfect.
110,5,"Loving my new iPhone 8! I’m way more careful with this one since it has a glass back, however, the color is pretty and looks good with the case I bought!"
111,5,"The iPhone 8Plus is a major upgrade from my old 6 Plus. Extremely fast and the quality of the picture is great. Miss the headphone jack when bluetooth headphones are charging. Great battery life. I get a full day with heavy use (email, gaming, internet searches). The best battery life of any iPhone I ever had (since first iteration)."
112,5,Upgraded from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 8 Plus. Very similar to iPhone 7 Plus. Do like the wireless charging capability.
113,4,He had a android before. He likes this better easier to operate
114,5,Learning new things on it each time I use it
115,5,I love how it is easy to work
116,4,The phone screen is bright and crystal clear. Everything worked straight away. I had no trouble setting it up.
117,5,"My 4th iPhone and this one is wonderful. I like the larger screen for easier reading, and the larger keypad for easier texting. I highly recommend the iPhone 8+"
118,5,My grandson picked out this phone and he loves it! Very cool!
119,5,I kept running out of space for pictures and mi games
120,5,Bought this on the 24 month plan. Was a better deal than the 7. As of now seemed like a smart purchase.
121,5,Cannot fault this product. Was thinking about the 8+but I am glad I went for this 1 as it’s light smaller and very easy to use
122,5,Fast new iPhone with great features and an extra year’s guarantee from JL.
123,5,The iPhones just keep getting better and better! I love the camera on this one.
124,5,I've had numerous iPhones in the past and this is by far my favourite with the larger screen. Initially sceptical about having a larger screen but really easy to use.
125,5,Easy to set up and simple to use. Very satisfied with the product!
126,5,Pretty consistent upgrade from the 6 to the 8... Works as advertised
127,3,"After making the switch from my original iPhone 6, I can only slightly detect a difference in speed when opening apps. The phone does unlock quicker, it does change screens faster, but overall the loading of content to screens is not worth upgrading from a 6. I would have replaced my battery in my 6 had my charging pins not failed. While I am happy with the phone- it simply does not seem to be an improvement."
128,3,"I am disappointed with this phone. It looks and do the same as my old iPhone 6 , so I don’t feel that I am having a new phone . I am going to return it today."
129,5,bought from here as you had the best offer good quick secure servicedoug
130,5,"Upgraded from the 5, such a difference! Much faster with excellent features as expected with I phone. Customer service great with John Lewis- Was lucky to find the phone on a special discount for one day only which happened to be on my birthday just before Christmas!"
131,5,"Great phone and great delivery, especially as it was ordered in the Christmas rush! Amazed at the 2 year warranty too. Big thank goes to John Lewis and Apple!"
132,4,"The battery seems to last a lot longer than my previous iPhone. It has some added features that make it more user friendly but also has a few quirks that to me are a little annoying. The annoying quirk, which if it keeps up I will be going back to ATT to see if something is wrong with it or if I'm doing something wrong, is that I have had to delete my finger print access twice and redo it to get into my phone without using the code. Other than that my wife and I really like our iPhones."
133,1,I upgraded from the 7 and it’s still No one can hear me the phone crackels. Can I get a iPhone that people can hear me with out out saying hello hwllo
134,5,Much faster speed and longer battery life.
135,5,"I thought it’d be too big, but I got used to the size quickly and have no intention of going back to buying smaller phones. The camera is amazing, the sound is surprisingly good and the screen is very nice too."
136,4,Have had IPhones for years and they keep getting better.
137,5,A good phone for your everyday needs and more! Great quality and wonderful service.

142,5,"I love my new phone, especially the battery, it holds up very well."
143,3,The iPhone-8 is an average phone (for now). I hope the IOS and battery will last a bit longer (this time).
144,5,Replaced my 6S with this phone. Great apple product that I am used to.
145,5,Love the way I can go from one thing to another much faster than before!!
146,5,Unfortunately I was forced to buy a new iPhone because my IPhone 5 would no longer hold a charge
147,2,"The first phone they gave me in the store completely malfunctioned before I left. Had to get me another. My old IPhone died before it was even paid off. They couldn't help me retrieve my info. Longtime Apple user, thinking of switching to another kind of phone."
148,5,Upgraded my daughter's aging iPhone 6 and she loves it. It's much faster and she is learning to use the new features of the phone. Lot of accessories for the phone as well.
149,5,Got this phone for my boyfriend's mom as her first cell phone and its amazing. Definately user friendly we both have Samsung's and i am still able to help her set it up.
150,5,I bought this phone for my mom. The camera is perfect. Easy for her to use and the picture is clear and concise.
151,5,This is an upgrade from an iPhone 6 and is much faster. Love the bigger screen.
152,5,"Love the new iPhone. Upgrading from a 6, a lot of new features"
153,4,"Love the iphones, have had them since the original. This 8 is great, but wish I would have gotten an X."
154,5,"love the new iPhone 8, the battery life is amazing compared to old iPhone"
155,5,"You could never go wrong with an iPhone. I didn't buy the X because I wasn't ready to let go of the home button just yet, but hey...maybe next years upgrade? ;)"
156,5,I Like the 8 the 10 is overrated and over priced it does have the similar features compared to the 10.
157,5,Great phone. Excellent clarity. Good upgrade from the 6plus
158,5,Excellent phone. Great upgrade from the 6 they had.
159,5,I upgraded my child to an iPhone 8 from a 6 and of course she loves it. She loved the Rose Gold color too!

162,1,Horrible phone. Don’t buy it
163,5,"I am came from a 6s and wanted a bigger screen. Really like it, wavered a bit because it is a little heavier than the 6s but was able to move past it. The camera is much improved from the 6s. It's a great phone!"
164,5,"Great pictures, faster and reliable, easy to use!."
165,5,Nice phone and I like the better cameras that it’s equipped with over my iPhone 6. Comfortable to use too while surfing the web
166,5,Compared to my old iPhone 5 this iPhone 8 is great. Much easier to read screen without needing glasses and less glare. Nice iPhone.
167,5,"Color is so beautiful. Phone is perfect size, fast and efficient. Downfall is it does not have portrait mode like the plus"
168,5,"Big but awesome. Fast, portrait camera is awesome, but too big for a pocket"
169,5,"Easy to use, great looking display."

174,5,"I upgraded our iPhones and we both love our new iPhone 8s. Faster, better resolution. Only thing is I don’t like how I can’t charge and listen to music at the same time. Will have to invest in Bluetooth earphones"
175,5,I love the iPhone. This is one of the best ones yet.
176,4,Faster with better battery life than its predecessors.
177,5,Purchesed for my wife to replace an old iphone 6. Much faster and the camera is much better. So far it is great
178,5,This phone rocks! From camera to speakers this phone has it all.
179,5,"I'm a middle aged woman trying to keep up with modern technology with the help of my 2 children. I converted from other phones to the iphone when the iphone 4 was current. I've upgraded to an iphone 6 and now finally the iphone 8 plus. It does everything and more. It was such a good phone that my children actually went in together to get their own in a BOGO free deal when we switched from Xfinity to DirecTV. So now we all have an iphone 8 plus, and needless to say, all of us are thrilled with the technology on this phone. It's the bomb dot com!!!"
180,5,I love my phone I got mainly for the camera to take pictures of my kids and it’s very clear and perfect
181,5,"I love this phone. faster then my 6s plus. Camera is great, the feel of the phone is very similar to my 6s plus so didn’t need to get use to anything new."

205,5,I really like the change. It’s been much smoother than I assumed it would be. I still struggle with some things but I have friends that are iPhone users to help. The speaker could be louder but other than that I love everything about the phone!
206,5,"No complaints , best phone and best place to buy it at"
207,5,Needed an upgrade. Camera is a definite improvement.

213,5,If you're considering buying this phone you won't regret it. It does take a little while to adjust to (especially coming from my Samsung) but it's so worth it! The battery life is amazing! It'll be one of the best purchases you make!
214,5,Upgraded my iPhone 7plus and got the 8plus the phones are exactly the same. No issues here
215,5,"I knew it was due time I upgraded my 6, so when I started doing research, everything kept drawing me to the 8. There was a noticeable difference in the upgrade, due to the quality of the phone itself, but also the features and clarity being projected. I love my new iPhone and if I had to do it over again, I would still select the 8 Plus."
216,5,Replaced my phone with the larger sized model. I like how easy it is to read messages and email. The camera is great.
217,5,Replaced my phone with this newer model. Like the camera.
218,5,I replaced the iPhone 6 with the iPhone 8. Love the new features.
219,5,I recently upgraded my iphone 6 to the iphone 8. The picture quality is better. I love this phone.
220,5,I've been an Apple product fan for several years and intend on staying that way. The iPhone 8 is another great product in Apple's line up.
221,4,So i’m not too please with the iphone 8 it’s not much of a difference from the 7 expect you can charge it wireless I guess that’s cool.
222,5,My wife loves her phone over my iPhone X. She likes the larger screen and how videos are alway full screen unlike the X. Rear camera is the same as the X too which is her favorite feature!
223,4,Bought as an upgrade from my iPhone 6. Noticeably faster with a better camera and a jimmy rigged front flash. If you’re looking for an upgrade from anything after the 6 it’s not worth the money. But it is an iPhone so there’s that.
224,5,I love my iPhone ! I had a Samsung for a couple months and I couldn’t wait to get an iPhone again
225,5,I’ve had every iPhone since they began. More fun features. Better camera. Easier to use light weight love it
226,5,Apple never ceases to amaze me! Upgraded my son’s SE to the 8.
227,5,Bought during holiday season. Bestbuy was offering 100 off so it was lowest price I could find
228,4,Bought this phone for my daughter who's an apple lover and she seems to love this phone
229,5,Excellent product with good updates! Great photo clarity. Perfect screen size. Slim and sleek product.
230,4,Still better than the iPhone X. Possibly the last iPhone with Home BUTTON
231,4,Still better than the iPhone X. Possibly the last iPhone with Home BUTTON.
232,5,"My daughter got this and she loves the phone plenty of space good camera, it’s way faster then her old 6s"
233,5,"My only complaint so far is that the phone itself is slick and flies out of my hands way too easily! had to get a sticky cover so the phone doesn't slide out of my hands just holding it. Still having to get used to the new layout and missing some of my apps because the developer is behind the times and hasn't updated the app, but I am very happy 1 month in."
234,5,This 8 plus is truly an upgrade from 6s. Love this phone.
235,5,"It’s an Apple product, what more is there to say???"
236,1,"Received as a Christmas present and am very disappointed and unsatisfied. When talking to another person, their is alot of static when the other person speaks or if there is any type of background noise on the other end. (Static/Noise pollution continued even after disabling the Wi-Fi tethering feature). The design, features, storage, camera and battery life ratings are irrelevant if the sound quality is poor and you are unable to talk to someone on the phone. Afterall, isn't that what a phone is for?!"
237,5,"I bought the IPhone 8 Plus and thought about returning it for Samsung Note Or IPhone X. Glad I kept the 8. I like that it’s familiar with some newer twists. The texting is better( not so many unwanted words being sent) and it’s much faster. Camera is really nice. I had to turn off Siri because it was always popping up when I pressed the home button. All in all, I’ll hang with Apple for a while and see how they improve the X."
238,5,Very happy with my 8. Good value upgrade from my iPhone 6s.
239,5,"Good size, love the picture quality, love the color."
240,5,"Good picture quality, good size, love the color, love so far."
241,5,Like the speed of the operating system; nice size for the hand; fast wireless charging. Nice improvement over the 7 Plus.
242,5,My daughter swears by apple products. She likes the things that she can do with it
243,5,Continues to be easy to use and many good features and functions.
244,5,Upgraded from the 6s plus and love it. Great investment for a phone.
245,5,Best iPhone ever love the camera an the wireless charger
246,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6 so this 8+ is definitely better! I have no complaints as of now.
247,5,Best iPhone ever love the camera an the wireless charger
248,5,Upgrade over the iPhone 6s Plus is well worth it. Great phone
249,5,Had the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8 Plus is much faster and has an excellent camera
250,5,Love the color of the rose gold. Great phone with great camera.
251,5,Love the new iPhone 8. A lot faster than the iPhone 6.
252,3,The home button drives me crazy it keeps taking me to Siri
253,4,It will take getting used to. Touch screen and buttons feel different.
254,5,"Moved up from iphone6. Camera is improved, processing is a little faster, and battery life is longer. Glad I made the switch"
255,5,Love the phone. My daughter was right in getting me to choose the plus.
256,5,Very happy with my new cell Love the silver color.
257,5,I am an Apple fan. I have yet to be disappointed in the products that I have purchased from them.
258,3,The 8 is exactly like an iPhone 7 only with fingerprint coding to unlock. Suggest if you have an iPhone 7 to not up grade to an 8 or x
259,5,It's a better iphone that has a great resolution for pictures.
260,5,"This phone was bought for my 16yr old, it has worked great and has great features. Definitely will keep the apple lover happy!!!"
261,5,Phone was purchased for my daughter which was great. But we had someone help us who had no experience and didn't bother transferring all my daughter's info from her own phone.
262,5,"This was an upgrade to her 6S, and she's really happy with it so far. It's fast and much more space for storage compared to her old phone."
263,5,The I phone 8 is very good nice features added. Better battery life. Recommend you consider I phone 8 when looking to upgrade existing phone or buying new
264,5,I've been a die hard iPhone person and the iPhone 8 doesn't disappoint. Really no issue and it's fast. Camera is great.
265,5,Best phone Apple has made. A must for any apple lovers.
266,5,"I needed to upgrade from my iPhone 6 Plus and considered all available phones. The iPhone 8 plus gave me all of the features plus a few I didn't need. Outstanding phone ""pocket computer""!"
267,4,Battery on phone is great. At times people have a hard time hearing me so not sure if it’s the phone or not
268,5,The best Apple has made. A must for all apple lovers.
269,5,Like it much better than the Galaxy S6 that I had.
270,5,"The I5 we were using had slowed as was somewhat unreliable. The I8 performs much better, particularly the battery life."
271,4,"After some initial difficulty getting the phone set-up, I have found the I8 an excellent upgrade from the I5c that it replaced. I have particularly noted that the battery life is much longer than the I5."
272,5,I loved my iPhone 7s so we had no extra thought on getting my son an 8 when his phone broke. Love the wireless charging.
273,5,We received good service with big purchase decisions. Husband switched to iphone after years and so far he’s pleased.
274,5,"My daughter loves this thing, then again what 11 year old wouldn't."
275,5,Good update. Fast processsor. Very happy with our purchase.
276,5,"Great phone, son loves new features from the 6s version."
277,5,I needed an upgrade pretty bad and this phone is very sleek and I love the color. I do recommend the glass screen protector for it. I’m still figuring out all of the features and the battery life so far is good.
278,5,This iPhone was the best purchase of 2017. I love the 8 plus
279,5,Great phone with great features. Daughter loves the new camera.
280,5,"Purchased phone for 16 year old daughter. She loves the phone, camera and larger size screen."
281,5,The iPhone 8 is an awesome phone. Nice design and quality.
282,5,love it works easy smooth transitions doesnt lag like some of the others.
283,5,I bought this phone for my 13 yr old daughter and she loves it
284,5,Easy to use camera with much better quality than previous versions. Best Buy staff were very helpful.
285,4,"The iPhone 8 features are excellent as advertised. 4 stars because I’ve have several episodes of phone freezing up during the 1 week I’ve owned it. I’ve read others have experienced this problem with iPhone 8 with Apple service providing little improvement, which is discouraging. I’m likely to take it to Best Buy &/or Apple in hopes a solution to this problem will be forthcoming."
286,5,First iPhone plus. So far so good! I like the bigger screen!
287,4,Love every aspect of this phone except there is no music jack output. Other than it rocks
288,3,I considered switching to Galaxy but decided to give Apple another try. No big wow with this upgrade from my 6s. I am not totally in love. Just feels like I am in a bland relationship with no changes. I will say the camera is much better but that is about all. Will likely switch to Samsung on my next round.
289,4,"As an Apple freak, the iPhone 8 was the logical choice. Chose the 8 Plus due to having large hands. It works. Some cool features."
290,5,Great phone and great camera. Would recommend to a friend.
291,5,Perfect size great camera easy to work beginner very satisfied
292,5,Perfect size great camera easy to work beginner very satisfied
293,5,"Great phone, great camera, easy to set up and tons of storage."
294,5,The best phone on the market! I can’t wait to use the wireless charging feature!
295,5,"Have been a Samsung Galaxy owner since the S4. Good phones, I never made the change due to freedom etc. what made me change was reliability. And well a lot of reviews and close friends told me Apple is more reliable and so far I have had phone for about 2 weeks w all the apps I had on my s7 edge and it’s running smooth and battery last longer"
296,5,Perfect size great camera easy to work beginner very satisfied
297,5,"The best phone in the market for now, The camera is highly awesome"
298,5,Better camera and a bigger screen. All around thumbs up
299,4,Just replacing my old iPhone 6. Did not want the X (ten) because of the facial recognition.
300,5,Best phone on the market. The camera is amazing. Not to mention the staff was very helpful.
301,4,"The phone functions just fine. It’s fast (of course, it’s new) and the perfect size. The only thing they seemed to be able to brag about was the glass back for wireless charging...which is nice but adds to the fragility of this phone. Not much else is new! I upgraded from a 6."
302,5,"I wasn't going too upgrade from my i-phone 6 too the 8, the 6 is working just fine, BUT I decided too go for it, Holy Moly what a difference, why did I wait so long, the câmara is my favorite it's awesome, I just got so I'm still figuring everything out, Don't wait go get one.."
303,5,Easy to use and a strong upgrade from my 2 year old 6S
304,4,nice product odd to handle at first......................
305,5,Great photos! Longer battery life than the 6s. Would definitely purchase again!
306,5,I love the phone. The size does take some getting use to after having a smaller phone.
307,1,I purchased this iPhone as a Christmas gift for my grandson (age 22). He has a photography hobby and owns many cameras. He is delighted by the quality of photographs taken with the iPhone 8 plus. On the day of the purchase I learned of the AT&T promotion offering two phones for the price of one. I took advantage of the promotion and have upgraded my phone from a 6 plus to an 8 plus.
308,5,faster and better than its previous version. love the screen and the seamless operation
309,5,"I had the iPhone 6, decided on the iPhone 8 plus. Really glad I went to plus size (i had resisted for a long time- didn't want something big) but now I don't know why I waited this long. I really like the size."
310,5,Upgraded from a iPhone 6 and I’m very happy about the new phone.
311,5,This was a upgrade for my son which was still using an iPhone 5.
312,4,"It's good, but not a whole lot different than the IPhone 6."
313,4,"Much faster than my iPhone 6 was even when the iPhone 6 was new. Battery life is pretty good. Invest in case and screen protector, cannot stress this enough. Scratches way too easily because of coating on the glass."
314,3,So far the iPhone 8 Plus is doing good. It has been working good
315,3,"So my daughter's iphone 5c was aging, being nearly 4 years old, and my iPhone 6 stopped working correctly, and I'm watching the lawsuit against Apple with glee. I wanted to go Samsung, but she loves apple, so I took one for the team, fully charged my ""6"" so it would work when evaluated for trade in, and got this phone as the 'buy one' part of the special AT&T was running under their Next program. Of course, my '6' was a 64Gb, and was nearly full after 3 1/2 years, so I sort of talked myself into getting the 256Gb beast. Apple could simplify all of our lives (theirs and ours) by just providing a slot for a standard memory expansion card (micro SD?) like other makers do for Android phones. Would make transferring or printing photos ever so much less sucky. BB staff was decent to work with, although some of the conversations between team members about disciplinary discussions were kind of unprofessional. Keep that stuff in the break room please."
316,3,"So my daughter's iphone 5c was aging, being nearly 4 years old, and my iPhone 6 stopped working correctly, and I'm watching the lawsuit against Apple with glee. I wanted to go Samsung, but she loves apple, so I took one for the team, fully charged my ""6"" so it would work when evaluated for trade in, and got this phone as the 'get one free' part of the special AT&T was running under their Next program. BB staff was decent to work with, although some of the conversations between team members about disciplinary discussions were kind of unprofessional."
317,5,"I'm so glad I went to Best Buy to buy our iPhones! The service was amazing and we are so happy with the selection they had, even right after the 8's were released!"
318,5,Love the picture quality. And storage in my phone yeah
319,5,"Love the phone! This was a BOGO to a iPhone X , my son loves it."
320,5,This was a replacement for an iPhone 6s that our son likes but he hasn't really changed what he does and it used 10 gigabytes of data in the first month. Before he was using about 4 gigabytes of data. We will take it to a Verizon store to see if they can help us fix it
321,4,"Due to ""battery"" conspiracy with Apple, I upgraded to the iPhone 8 Plus rather than the iPhone X. There have been too many problems with the X, and it is not the size of the Plus devices, so I will have to hold out until next year. HOWEVER, THIS PHONE IS NOT THAT BAD AT ALL!"
322,5,Phone is great. Lots of new features. Has awesome storage space and is faster than my IPhone 6 I had.
323,5,"I have had each plus since the 6, I wouldn’t have upgraded so soon but my 7 started acting up and so I jumped the gun and just upgraded. Well instead of the Best Buy members just looking to see if they could help me with my old phone they just jumped on the sale of course and come to find out I just needed to upgrade to the new update on my 7. So now I feel like I have two of the same exact phones. Cannot tell any difference between the two."
324,5,apple doesnt fail with the iphone 8 i have been a user for years and will continue
325,5,I love the size of the screen and the resolution. : )
326,5,I really enjoy my New I phone8....so much faster and does a lot more than my old phone. But customer service was absolutely terrible....no one could activate my phone and I had to go to Tuscaloosa to the AT&T’s store to get activated....jasmine was absolutely wonderful and got me activated in a few minutes....give her a pay raise bc she solved my problem and 3 customer service reps and 2 hours on phone NEVER gott an answer
327,1,It’s just like IPhone 7. The only reason I got it because it was free.
328,5,"I went from 5SE to 8 and really like the differences....display, camera, battery life, etc."
329,5,I purchase this phone for my girlfriend. She is very happy with the Iphone 8. This was an upgrade purchase from a 6s.
330,5,I purchased the 8 because I wanted to have a faster phone and more gb. I am very happy with this purchase. Can't go wrong with Apple.
331,5,We needed an upgrade that would be durable for our pre-teen. This phone has all of the specifications desired.
332,5,Upgraded from a 6 plus and the difference is insane. Highly recommend the upgrade if you need one.
333,5,No question this phone is better than most others on the market right now. My wife loves the phone.
334,5,Birthday girl loves her iPhone 8 would definitely purchase more apple products.
335,5,Much faster all around with improved menus and features
336,5,If your not into the new X iPhone but want to upgrade still this is a great phone to get. Similar to iPhone 7 but adds on wireless charging option which is very convenient. Fast and great camera. Feels a bit heavier due to glass and more susceptible to shattering if dropped. I would recommend getting a case : )
337,5,these versions i feel has better battery life time
338,5,I’ve owned a lot of phones in the past but nothing compares to the iPhone 8 one of the fastest phones I have ever owned especially compared to the galaxy s7 edge. One thing I really don’t like is not being able to put an sd card in and expanding the memory. But other than that it’s a really good phone
339,5,"Love the rose gold finish option on this model. The phone is massive, and I love it. Great camera with new features, nice big screen. Great phone choice."
340,5,"Love the massive size. Has some great features my iPhone 6 didn't have. Like the screen size, camera options. Quality phone!"
341,5,"Nothing much has changed, but the camera on this thing is legit!"
342,5,Highly recommend the iPhone 8 for anyone interested in getting an iPhone
343,4,Got this phone for my wife as an upgrade from her iPhone 6. Better camera with the 8. She loves it.
344,5,I looked over several phones and finally came back and purchased the iPhone 8. Other phones seem to want to be what iPhone already is. They may have 1 or 2 specialty features but the iPhone 8 blows them away with all it offers.
345,4,I got this for my daughter. It is a perfect phone for a teen.
346,5,Good built and camera quality. Upgraded ithe device after long time and can see visible difference from last handset.!
347,3,"Upgraded from the iPhone 6s to the 8. I have not noticed a difference in speed between the two phones. In fact this is my second iPhone 8 in two months since the first one was having issues. Also this screen scratches easily. Apple says one of there most scratch resistance screens. I have never put a screen protector on any of my iPhone and I have never had scratches. The phone is in my side pocket of my purse, my back pocket, or on my desk. The first iPhone 8 scratched within the first few weeks. My replacement scratched quickly also. I see YouTube videos of people trying to scratch the screen and not being successful so I have no idea how these two phones have scratched. Not impressed. Will put a screen protector on now, but should we have to keep buying accessories to protect our phones? My 2 cents."
348,5,Really nice phone. Feels perfect in my hand. It's very fast. Takes excellent photos and video. Battery lasts very long time. Put a minimalist cover on it and a tempered glass screen protector - didn't change the feel of the phone. Love iOS. Another great Apple product!
349,5,This is my first Iphone. I have been a Samsung Galaxy user for the last several years. There is no comparison to the Iphone. So many more user friendly apps that are Iphone supported.
350,5,"Sure I am a lemming who has bought into the iOS universe. Fine. But this is a nice upgrade from my SE, which was just under two years old and is still running well and holding a charge. Haptic feedback is smooth and was an easy transition, and I now need a slightly larger screen. OLED is stunning! All around we are very pleased, especially with the BOGO, which is not as easy to find with our particular carrier."
351,5,"Upgrade from an iPhone 6, love the bigger screen, the much improved camera and excellent speed of this new phone. Also like the wireless charging capability.Only downside is the hefty weight of the phone, but that's the price you pay for the bigger screen."
352,5,I always had Samsumg phones until I got my new IPhone8 and I love it ! The camera is great and it is so easy to work with. The battery lasts for few days. I am very happy with my choice.
353,5,This phone was purchased for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas! It has been a big hit. The camera is great!
354,5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves the larger phone and the camera is awesome!
355,5,I wasnt sure Id like my phone. But I love it and its easy to use.
356,5,"I purchased this iPhone for my son, and he loves it!"
357,5,"I upgraded to this phone from an iphone 5. Needless to say, there's a huge difference between them! I went with the Plus and not the regular because of the photo features on the Plus. So far, it has not disappointed! I also love the color. It looks more pink than gold. I'm very happy about my purchase."
358,5,"I upgraded to this phone from an iphone 5. Needless to say, there's a huge difference between them! I went with the Plus and not the regular 8 because of the photo features on the Plus. So far, it has not disappointed! I'm very happy about my purchase."
359,4,The pictures are great! The iPhone 8 is awesome!! My Apple Music did not transfer over to my new phone but that was my only issue
360,5,This is the first IPhone I have owned. It takes some getting used to but so far I like it
361,3,A little buggie. I’m updated with the latest SW updates but there are still some bugs. I want my version 5 back.
362,4,Only difference I see at all is the 64g storage in the 8 compared to the 6S. Kind of wish I would of just gone to the iPhoneX. I thought the 8 had the portrait mode but nope only the plus.
363,5,"Photo great, much clearer than other iPhone"
364,3,"I thought I would love my new iPhone 8 Plus but it freezes quite a bit. My 6 Plus was much better. Also, AT&T really doesn’t offer upgrades, you pay full price for phone and get stuck with another contract with them."
365,5,Upgraded to the iPhone 8 from Samsung S5. No comparison! Outstanding phone! Outstanding value.
366,4,"I just recently got this phone, but so far so good! I haven’t had a problem with it and it seems to work great! Super happy about the extra storage also"
367,4,My son was quite happy with his Christmas upgrade.
368,4,My daughter was very surprised with her phone upgrade.
369,5,"Big improvement from the 6s series, and great price pop by if you don’t want to make the leap to that $1k iPhone X."
370,5,"Outstanding improvement with camera versus my iPhone 6s Plus. The portrait mode is awesome. The new os is smooth as silk, due to improved processor, and the battery life is significantly better."
371,5,I'm not an iPhone person but my kids are...he is a happy guy
372,5,Bought this for my son for Christmas and he love's it
373,2,I'm sending it back. Just too expensive.
374,5,Upgraded from 6 & am very impressed with how much better this phone is. It’s faster & holds a charge a lot longer.
375,5,I purchase this phone for my daughter and she loves it
376,5,"great , great , great ,great, great, great, great,"
377,5,"apple items are very good products to by for gifts,"
378,5,If you’re a apple person this is the phone for you.
379,5,"Great camera, great picture. Works good with my Mac laptop"
380,5,One of the best iPhone. If you have been on the fence regarding upgrading I would highly recommend to upgrade to the iPhone 8 Plus! Stand out features: - Great display - Long last battery - Wireless charging - Quick charging - Fast processor The iPhone 8 Plus is a great buy highly recommended!
381,5,much faster than my 5s
382,5,Bought this phone as an upgrade. It has been a delight. The updates are user friendly and the display is so clear.
383,5,Looks great and works better. Fast and full of so many goodies I love Siri and now there so many more voices and accents. Smart as it is good looking
384,5,What can I say? This is an Apple phone. Nothing will ever top Apple products
385,4,I bought this to replace an older iphone 5. It is a better phone that has more features than my last phone. The only drawback so far was how long it took to start up and copy over my info from my last phone. I was in the store at least an hour waiting for it to download.
386,5,I chose the iPhone 8plus over the x with a lot of thought. At the end what mattered to me was the camera which is the same exact camera as the X. Saving me some major money I went with the 8Plus and very pleased with my choice.
387,5,"I upgraded from my iPhone 7, although not a huge difference but it’s obvious Apple continues to produce the most reliable phones on the market."
388,5,"This phone is a race horse; very fast processor, great camera, crisp, clear screen."
389,5,Bought this for my teenage boys. They love it. Said the camera is so much better plus it’s faster.
390,5,APPLE BRAND IS THE BEST. EVERYTHING IS SO SIMPLE AND I WOULD NEVER GO WITH ANY OTHER BRAND.
391,5,all i can say is the phone is great and work for me
392,5,"great phone and my wife love it, she use it for everything"
393,5,Great Apple product and great price offered for Verizon customer. Bought this phone for myself as a Christmas gift to myself. Best Buy always have inventory this product.
394,5,Exactly what I ordered............................
395,5,"Switched from the 6. Of course, the 8 is hard not to like. Better camera, better battery (ahem), better speed. Not drastically different from the 6, but a nice improvement if you're due for an upgrade."
396,5,"What can I say, it's pretty. Switched from the 5S is a nice change."
397,5,It’s fast and keeps up with me. The camera is very clear and the phone holds everything I need it to. It’s extremely user friendly and fun. Keeps me connected.
398,5,love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
399,5,i would recommend this phone to anybody love it!!!
400,5,The size is perfect and it takes amazing photos! Love everything about it.
401,5,I love this phone. It has awesome picture and battery life.
402,5,Best Buy had daily door buster deals and this was one of the last ones. Saved a $100 on a 256gb ip8. Can’t go wrong. My wife’s loved it and she will never run out of space for the baby pics. Keep up the deals Best Buy!
403,5,"I love my new IPhone 8! I upgraded from a 6s. The camera is fantastic and the processing speed is very good too. I received the phone in the mail, activated it and mailed my old one back. Very easy!!"
404,5,Fast and pretty. It’s light and large. I like it very much.
405,5,The 8 has a nice crisp display and better camera than the 6.
406,5,My kids love their new phones....bought as Christmas presents and they couldn't be happier. They were on android....
407,4,"I love the size of this phone it is not too small and not too big! The camera is great, my pictures are so much clearer than my old phone!"
408,5,This is the best iphone to date. Very fast and clear picture.
409,5,"My wife loves this phone. She states it does it all from apps, movies, messaging, games, pictures and videos"
410,5,So far this phone has been great. Especially the camera and video which i use a lot
411,5,Very reliable phone. Not too big easy to use great phone
412,5,My old phone was a 5s thus the improvements are striking. Much to learn but initial use of the camera is very impressive
413,5,"We were initially very skeptical about the size of the 8+, as we upgraded from the 5! However, we love it!!! We also are really enjoying The extra storage and the absence of the “not storage” pop up!! Love the upgraded camera/photo options. Amazing!"
414,5,Although it took sometime to get working just with plan changes and activation this is a great phone.
415,5,at first my wife thought this would be too large - wouldn’t fit in hands or pockets and be too hard to adjust to. after a few weeks it’s hard to imagine what we were using before. we BOTH got one of these. she really likes the white color. i went with black. so far so great.
416,5,iphone is the standard for me. i’ve had just about every incarnation.. keep coming back b/c they just always work. never had a bad one. the X is way overpriced. hope they work that situation out.
417,5,"My son loves this phone and says it has a really nice camera. Once you go to the larger phones, you never go back."
418,4,My new 8 iPhone receives better WiFi and Bluetooth connection than the 5S I previously owned. I like the slightly big size. Battery of course last longer
419,5,Always love the iphones. Takes a little getting used to but I wouldn’t get anything else
420,5,Love the upgrades! Would recommend protective case since the back is now glass too.
421,4,"Love this iPhone, I’ve had apple products since the very first Mac book and iPhone and I recommend Apple every time. Their product may be priciest compared to “ Microsoft “ but I’ve owned both types in laptop and phone version and Apple products have always been virus free maintenance free and trouble free for me, I have never had issues with Apple!!"
422,5,This is my first smart phone. I chose a IPhone because it is set up just like my iPad. Love the size of the plus. Looked at the reviews for the different iPhones and decided on the 8 Plus. I liked the 8 Plus better than the X.
423,5,I went from the Galaxy S6 Edge plus to the 8 plus and I absolutely love it! What a super sleek phone! Everyone should have it!
424,4,"The iPhone eight downloads rapidly. The typing out of voicemail messages seems to be a good idea. I am enjoying the low light camera. I still prefer the size of the iPhone 5 at this point. For some reason,the phone seems to require more data than my previous phone. This phone seems to make more mistakes in “talk to text“ then my previous phone, but maybe it will get used to my speech after a while. It made about 15 mistakes as I tried to “talk to text” this review, for example. The battery also seems to deplete quicker than I expected. Mostly, though, I expect to get used to it and it’s new features overtime and to enjoy how many things you can do for me."
425,4,I upgraded from the iPhone 6 and I guess I expected a little more. The battery life does seem to be a lot better though.
426,3,My last 6s was perfectly fine until all of a sudden my battery started acting weird. So I got the new phone instead of a battery.
427,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6. The iPhone 8 is much faster & I like the convenience of wireless charging.
428,5,If you are a fan of the iphone than this one is what you are looking for. If you have a older one consider replacing the battery if you don't want to spend money on a new phone.
429,5,Phone is great slick and works great with all my apps
430,5,Love this phone! Easy to use and big screen for older eyes.
431,5,My son loves his new phone!! He didn't have any problems setting up his phone or using his phone.
432,4,Not much different than my iphone 7. I upgrade every year but not ready for the X. I like having a home button. Wish I had gotten the gold instead. Home button is hard to see in dim light.
433,5,It was hard switching from Samsung to Apple a year ago but I am hooked now.
434,4,I don’t find much different between the iPhone 7+ and the 8+. However I do love the camera. I’m very happy that it fits my accessories of the iPhone 7+
435,5,We love the new camera feature that it offers. Quality of phone is great.
436,5,Huge change from the 6s to 8. My daughter is very pleased with it
437,5,"I really don’t see a big difference with any of the other IPhones, it’s ok"
438,5,This phone was less what we wanted to do and more what we had to do after a catastrophic iphone 7 plus disaster. My wife says that this phone is much better and that she loves it. What more could I ask for?
439,5,I brought this as a gift to my daughter. She loves everything about the phone from the size to the upgrade. This phone is better than the 7 & X
440,5,Apple 8 is so much faster than my 6. Does everything I need and more.
441,5,Love the new phone. Always love apple products and this phone is living up to the Apple standards so far
442,5,We made my daughter very happy with a new phone. We are having trouble porting over her current number from T-mobile to Sprint though. Hopefully it will be resolved soon.
443,5,Very happy that I stuck with the apple product too
444,4,"When I finally resolved to upgrade from my iPhone 5S, the decision came down to the 8, 8+, or X. I went with the 8 because I preferred the more compact size, and didn't feel like the extra $300 justified the facial recognition, better camera, etc. that the iPhone X offers. I went with 64G because I don't store a lot of content (music, videos, etc.) on my phone; I keep most of my content library in iCloud and download as needed. So far, I'm really liking this phone, but there has been one issue: poor cellular reception in my house, which has also been a problem for my wife with her iPhone 6. This was never an issue with my 5S but there have been multiple occasions with the iPhone 8 where people have had difficulty hearing me (although I could hear them fine). It could be a Verizon issue or it could be a phone issue, I'm not sure. Will try to post an update once I have more info."
445,5,As advertised...wife wanted a phone with a bigger screen and this delivers
446,5,I love my iPhone. This one is better weighted then previous models.
447,5,"This phone has a few more nice additional features, such as: Pages & Numbers. The camera is improved with sharper pictures!"
448,5,I like the size compared to my old 6s. The speakers are louder then previous versions I owned and the speed is awesome for apps and games. Can’t go wrong with an ADA complaint phone.
449,5,i loved it very practical and up to date device i think its wonderful and as a deal its a good one
450,4,Always Apple provides best smartphones. I definitely recommend to my friends.
451,5,"The I phone 8 has very fast response, photos are phenomenal. Beautiful true color, and extensive editing possibilities"
452,5,Love my New Apple 8+. Very fast and reliable. Battery life is also great!
453,5,"My second Iphone, excellent product. Concerned about recent battery issue, but flawless thus far."
454,5,"I love the rose gold color, it's gorgeous! I bought a clear cover so the color will still show in its protected case."
455,5,"But the iPhone 8's camera alone is so far superior, battery life is excellent, & option for wireless charging is magical."
456,5,I absolutely love this phone!!!!!! It does everything for me!!!!! Definitely happy I didn’t wait to get the iPhone X!!!!!
457,5,Bigger screen for better viewing and great for web surfing!
458,5,My best ever phone by far it is much faster than iphone 7
459,5,Very happy with my new iPhone however found that apple caused the problems with the batteries on purpose!! Very upset with apple
460,5,This phone is awesome! Does everything I need it to do and more
461,5,"I bought this phone right before the iPhone X came out and I am glad I did. It is very fast, has a beautiful screen and a very capable camera. Plus it is relatively cheap compared to the other flagship phones that came out this year."
462,5,Great camera and easy to read. Love the new portrait mode.
463,5,"I was skeptical of the 8 Plus vs the 8 just based upon size, but very convenient for email."
464,5,Best iPhone ever! So fun to use. Love the facial recognition!
465,5,I’m happy that he’s happy thank you Apple and Best Buy
466,5,The screen size is perfect for any type of function you may want to perform.
467,5,This iphone has all the features I would ever want.
468,5,"great product my 3rd phone, the wife can keep her samsung give me the iPhone"
469,5,Got this as a 2nd iPhone 8 with the buy one get one on AT&T Next. Needed the extra line too.
470,5,I like this phonel it is fast and easy to charge and I like the button on the side rather than the top to make it go to sleep.
471,5,The iPhone 8 replaced an iPhone 5. Not into replacing whenever a newer model comes out. iPhone X was more than I really needed. The look and feel of the new iPhone is perfect.
472,5,great iphone with great camera and wireless charging capabilities..
473,5,The best iPhone to date. I recently traveled to New Orleans and didn’t need a professional camera to take awesome pictures. Using the internet and taking pictures did not drain the battery. Apple finally got it right!
474,5,"Great phone, great camera, water resistance is awesome. works great and is fast."
475,5,This a must have product for people that care about their phones
476,5,Got our second iPhone 8 and we are Delighted with it ! Thanks AT&T Informed our friends of the sale Best Buy has going!!
477,5,"I’m still exploring the phone features which are many, but this is a great iPhone. The only problem I have is getting use to the size of the iPhone plus."
478,5,Going from an iPhone 5 which was slow to an iPhone 8 was challenging but so worth it! Thanks to AT&T we got another iPhone 8 and went from a iPhone 6 to a iPhone 8 was wonderful! Now we both have the same phone ! Can’t get any better than this!!
479,5,Great phone great camera just can’t say anything bad about it
480,5,Great phone. Easy to use. Battery life seems better than my 6.
481,5,Love my new iPhone 8plus-I’d resisted going to the larger size but find it’s easier to use.
482,5,"I upgraded from an iPhone 6 and it’s faster and the camera is better. I like the “live” feature when I take pictures. There’s a few seconds of video, like a gif, so that I can pick the frame I like best for the still shot."
483,5,Great phone but bought because of software glitch at apple not known till day after. Apple would not reimburse for new obligation. Sad. But again great phone.
484,4,The phone is very good for people that want a larger apple device
485,5,Have had about a month now Not that much different from my 6 and for me that’s a good thing It is faster
486,5,seriously this phone is the best of the best the battery lasts forever and the phone makes your life easier
487,4,Just the same old iPhone. Just with better spec than last gen.
488,5,"This is my 4th IPhone, started out with a 4s and wow does that seem antique now. I upgraded from a 6s plus to this one and really wasn't expecting a big change. I can tell that this one is much faster and like the new camera features. I was bummed after upgrading my 6s to IOS 11 because there were many times it locked up and a few of my apps didn't work well. I think apple needs to do more testing on older phones before throwing out a new os to everyone. I really like the wireless charging also. I was afraid I wouldn't charge through my Otter Box defender case but sat it down on my charge pad and away it went. I bought the Belkin power up charge mat and it works great, faster than using the oem cable. So far I really like my 8+, was gonna go with the X but figured I do that one ( or what ever the new model is by then) next time."
489,5,"It is fast, cool and modern. Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!"
490,5,Best option of the current available iPhones. Liked the fact that it still has the home button.
491,5,I upgraded to iPhone 8 Plus from an iPhone 6s Plus
492,5,Excellent phone. Was hesitant to choose between iPhone X and 8plus. Very happy I chose this phone.
493,5,"Holds a charge very well, camera works great and I can make telephone calls with it!"
494,4,"Decent phone. Nothing special about it. Basically just like my 6S Plus. Works, and that’s the main thing."
495,5,"Great phone, a bit heavy but takes great pictures."
496,5,I love this phone. Camera is great. Love the extra starting storage space
497,5,Phone is awesome screen is much bigger from upgrading from a 6s. Black color is much better than gray
498,5,Phone is awesome screen is much bigger from upgrading from a 6s
499,5,Phone works great. Love the front and back camera. Very pleased with battery life also.
500,5,I am really glad I upgraded my phone to the 8. Pictures are clearer & features are worth it.
501,4,"Upgraded from a iPhone 6s Plus. Got this instead of the 8 because I liked the bigger phone. But since my iOS updated before I got the new phone, I don’t really notice anything that would be worth upgrading from a 6 to an 8."
502,5,I had an iPhone 6s and this phone is user friendly as well with more bells and whistles. Good alternative to the more expensive iPhone X.
503,5,The iPhone 8 is a nice upgrade from the 6. The processor is faster and the camera is a good upgrade.
504,5,This phone is pretty much like prior models but new.
505,5,"This is my wife's phone, she upgraded from Iphone 7, she is getting used to the larger size but other then that she loves it."
506,5,"If you like iPhones this will be no different. Ive always had an iPhone and am happy with the ease of use. This is my first time with the Plus model. Still getting used to the size, but no a big deal."
507,5,Very happy with the new phone I was due for an upgrade for a long time. Phone is reliable battery life is much better than before.
508,5,I have always been an android user but this new phone is amazing.
509,5,I love apple so when I had to up grade I got a 8....love it pictures are great....and wireless charge
510,4,"I mean it’s an iPhone, what can I really say. It was a great door buster deal when I purchased and I was forced to upgrade from a 6 due to software compatibility issues with AR Apps."
511,5,It's a iPhone what more do I have to say....we needed new phones so we upgraded
512,5,About Time. I was in dire need of an upgrade. It was worth it.
513,4,"Same as any other iPhone. Works fine now, just hope that it will continue to work as time goes on."
514,5,"Can’t seem to ever leave Apple. I just keep upgrading. Love the latest technology, faster speed, better camera"
515,5,Phone is the same as 7s. Once you use apple products it’s hard to switch
516,5,It’s a good phone to have and easy to use for all people
517,5,"Received this item as a buy one get one free promotion. Love the QI charging, fast processor and awesome camera. Highly recommended!!"
518,5,My son upgraded from an iPhone 6+ to the 8+. He loves have no more space and the size is optimal.
519,5,This is a good phone overall. Didn’t notice any improvement over the 7. Back glass is very slippery would recommend a case
520,5,great product- as with All Apple products. Zero interest for 24 months with $150 instant discount. No brainer
521,5,"The only way to go, super fast and a very nice look in gold."
522,5,My wife is very pleased with this latest rendition.
523,5,I wanted a IPhone with a larger screen and more memory and the 8 plus does the job. I love that it was available in gold tone.
524,5,As expected the upgrade was seemless and the phone is great. Really like the water resistant and larger screen the 8 plus provides.
525,5,"iPhone 8 Plus is exceptional, just like its ancestors. Very happy with no complaints."
526,5,The best camera I have ever had on a mobile phone. The wireless charger ability is great too.
527,5,"Went from a 6 to an 8, nothing much to say, it’s an iPhone."
528,5,"Went from a 6 to the 8. Much faster but not much to say, it’s an iPhone."
529,5,"So far, I really like this phone. The cost is pretty high but that’s Apple I guess."
530,4,"I like Apple products in general, but that said the prices are rather absurd. Nice upgrade from a 5."
531,4,The salesman could of been a lil more patient with me
532,4,So far an excellent phone. Battery life is good. Ear phones little funny
533,5,Very satisfied with the iPhone 8 Plus and it has exceeded all my expectations on performance. I was a little worried it might be too big coming off the iPhone 5s but I found it is perfect.
534,5,I live the phone and the amount of space. I love the size of the phone too
535,5,This iPhone works perfectly on the AT&T network. Very satisfied!
536,4,Haven’t had the phone long but the only difference I notice between this and my iPhone 6 is the battery life and the camera are better
537,5,Bought this phone for my teenage daughter she loves it. Great camera!
538,4,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift, no complaints thus far."
539,5,We got this for my daughter for Christmas she loves it!
540,4,Upgraded from iPhone 6s. Both ny husband and I had problems with our 6s. So far we are pleased.
541,5,My son was very happy to receive his christmas present. Best present ever
542,5,Would have like the iPhone X but it was too expensive. Love the portrait mode in this phone. Wish they would have done it on the iPhone 8 too. The size of this phone is a little jig for my hands
543,5,Bought two for Christmas gifts when they were on sell to replace the 6 that was running slow and shutting down. Works like all the rest of the iphones. Just cost way too much!
544,5,Love this phone.........................................................................................................
545,5,So far so good. Lots of new features. Amazing camera. Easy to navigate still
546,5,I'm very happy with this phone. It is the best one I have had so far and the camera part of it is just icing on the cake. I'm very pleased with the speed of the phone and apps as well as the screen is large enough for me to see easily. The camera also rocks if i have not mentioned that yet.
547,5,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6 and am happy that I did. The 8 is not much different, so nothing new to learn. Im glad I upgraded."
548,5,I am not quite sure if this is better than the X but for me it is just what I wanted and needed for the time being. It does what every other Iphone SHOULD do.
549,4,"What's there to say... it's an iPhone, just like the model before it, but slightly faster with more storage. Yay."
550,5,I once again am very pleased with my iPhone purchase.
551,5,This was a great upgrade for my wife! She had a 6 previous that was slow and took great pictures
552,5,I upgraded from a iPhone 6 with this one reacting much faster and had better picture quality
553,5,"I upgraded from a 6s plus to this phone. Though not a huge difference in software, the camera along for video recording is awesome. Worth the upgrade just for the camera."
554,5,"The best phone so far,just as good as the X, but better price. I Will recommend."
555,5,"Got the gold iPhone for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. It is very pretty, and has plenty of memory for all the apps she wants."
556,5,256GB of storage! Definitely worth a few extra bucks. My wife will never delete a picture again.
557,5,Battery life is better than my 6 plus and is faster.
558,5,"Best iPhone I have ever owned, ever fast perfect screen size."
559,5,The 8Plus takes clear beautiful pictures and is incredibly fast. I love it!!
560,5,The iphone 8 plus is a cool phone. No need to buy the iphone X. Takes some nice pictures and it is very quick to respond to any command.
561,5,"Love this phone. Holds charge longer and seems faster. Also, same size as my 6s. Didn’t want a giant phone! So far, so good!"
562,5,So far so good. I got my son the 7 and i upgraded myself to the 8.
563,5,"This is one the best apple phones ever! Great picture quality, sound and size! This is a must for diehard apple fans!"
564,5,So far this iphone 8 plus works great. Have had no problems since buying it three weeks ago.
565,5,I’m coming from the IPhone 5S and I feel like wow this is new smart phone technology. Simple yet “perfect” really love the HD camera and live picture feature.
566,4,Apple next generation iPhone is really nice easier to use but a little too big
567,5,I wanted a bigger size and this phone is great ...
568,5,Kids love this and I have had fun playing when they let me. 5 Star!
569,5,Very happy with my new phone to replace an Iphone 6 that had seen better days.
570,5,upgraded from IPhone 6. The features on this phone are worth the upgrade.
571,5,"Had the 6 prior and now enjoying the new features, would have liked to know about the batter cpu slowdowns bad kept my old phone, but either way enjoying this new iPhone"
572,5,"Love the phone especially the features, camera takes great photos"
573,5,"Upgraded from a 6s, this phone is much faster and feels better than the previous one I had. I only wish apple would lower their price point."
574,4,Upgraded to next new generation phones happy with purchase
575,5,The whole experience was wonderful. I will definitely buy from them again!
576,5,I like that it has lots of storage. The screen doesn’t get smeared like other screens do. I’m still learning things on this phone.
577,1,Huge problem: paid full price for an unlocked unit. It ended up being unlocked for the US and neither Apple nor Best Buy can do anything to resolve
578,5,"I went to Verizon to buy a new iphone 8, but after waiting 45 minutes, was informed they were sold out. Went over to Best Buy, and not only was there no waiting, my phone was UP AND RUNNING and I was leaving the store in LESS than 45 minutes! Same phone, same Verizon payment plan, same everything AND friendly, polite, knowledgeable customer service at Best Buy! We will purchase all our phones here from now on!"
579,5,I was first I was hesitant to upgrade from the 7 and to the 8 Plus due to size but love the new phone.
580,5,Apple did not dissapoint with this iPhone and FAR EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS ON THE BATTERY LIFE!!!!! AMAZING!!!!
581,5,"I like the battery life over my old iPhone 6. I was worried about the size of the phone, but am glad I didn't go with the smaller iPhone 8. I only wish they didn't get rid of the 3.5 mm headphone port."
582,5,I expect quality from Apple and was not dissapointed with their iPhone 8 Plus. BUT......was blown away with how long the battery lasts.....truly amazed!
583,5,Great upgrade if your going from the 6 plus to this. Camera is way better.
584,5,This is a geeat phone could be a little cheaper but the camera is great
585,5,"Great all around phone, like the new features and camera quality."
586,5,This is my 6th iPhone and from my perspective the best I have owned yet. Super fast and now with wireless charging.
587,5,"Really nice phone, camera is awesome!"
588,4,"Great phone and like that the 7,8,X are maintaining the same size of phone and just changing the screen. Camera very good."
589,5,"Very easy to set up! It takes beautiful pictures, and it has many new safety future."
590,4,"I received this phone free for activating a line for my son. It’s not as good as the X, but it’s pretty close."
591,4,I bought the I Phone 8 for my daughter for Christmas. She was absolutely thrilled with it. It does a lot more than my I Phone 6 does.
592,5,turned the home phone in to cell phone. and ofcourse it was buy one get one free with AT&T
593,5,excellent products and more and more new features.
594,5,I bought this phone for my brother. The picture quality is great and he loves the phone
595,4,This phone replaces an iphone 5 and it was a very smooth transition for such a jump. A few new things to learn but not overwhelming.
596,5,"This phone is very fast, sharp, and has a super camera"
597,4,My wife gave me her old iPhone 5 a couple years ago. She got a new 6 plus. I was going to take her old 6 so she could get a new one and instead she bought me the iPhone 8 for Christmas. I love this phone.
598,5,"Not much to say that others haven't said already. Great phone and features, battery life is amazing. Very happy!"
599,4,"Got this phone for my father-in-law to upgrade this old iPhone. I am knocking one star out because my father-in-law gets unwanted notification reminders about setting up apple pay since he doesn't want it. I had to enable it but not include any cards to avoid the annoying notifications. I do like the zoom feature which makes everything bigger, which is great for older adults."
600,5,"I love all the features and ease of use of the iphone 8 plus. It is a little large for my purposes to use when running and working out, I prefer the size of the iphone 8. However, my daughter loves the size of the 8 plus to watch nextflix. Great screen."
601,5,I did not intend on upgrading my phone until I dropped the 6s I had and cracked the screen. I am very happy that I upgraded. The 8 is so much faster and the graphics are great.
602,5,This phone is pretty nice I’m not gunna lie I recommend
603,5,Would recommend for other Iphone users; creature of habit and so far so good.
604,4,"Not what you expect, if you have a 7 going to the 8 is not a big jump"
605,5,"My wife loves this device. Her only complaint was adjusting to the large size. She loves everything about it - speed of processing, ease of use, and size of storage (256G). I’ve made a monster and now she’s always going to want a “phablet”. I ordered this for self install and had no problem setting it up at home."
606,5,Apple upgrade #3. We love the operating system and Apple features.
607,5,My daughter’s first choice! Very pleased with that choice.
608,5,"I was nervous about the larger screen, but in the end... I love it!!"
609,4,I am upgrading from an iPhone 6. Awesome and powerful phone.
610,5,I’ve owned many iPhones and the 8 still works as well as others. The volume on it doesn’t seem as loud as previous models but everything else is what you would expect in iPhone series.
611,5,Great phone excellent reception and style one of a kind
612,4,It runs a lot faster than my iPhone 6s and has a much better camera.
613,4,"Great camera, better than the previous iPhone 6s. Recommend."
614,5,Love the Phone. Great Apple Product. B Easy to set up and transfer all the data and history from my previous Iphine.
615,4,It a good product. Apple is now the top of my price point. Looked at the iPhone X. Just wasn’t worth the extra $$$. I went for 8plus instead. Dont see myself going beyond its price for a phone.
616,5,Upgraded from my iPhone 6 Plus. Love all the new features and especially the clear picture and awesome pictures it takes.
617,5,Live my new iPhone. Takes great pictures Would recommend
618,5,Was an iphone 6 owner....switched to a Samsung s7 phone about a year ago......now back over to an iphone 8. That statement says it all! Happy to be back!
619,5,Takes nice pictures. Contacts are well organized and easy access
620,5,I LOVE THE PHONE!!!!!!!! LOVE ALL APPLE PRODUCTS. GREAT PRICES
621,5,The IPhone 8 Plus is a really great phone and I love the camera
622,5,SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY OLD 5S PHONE WHICH WAS IN NEED OF A NEW BATTERY. GLAD I MADE THE LEAP.
623,5,Love it. Always need an android but got sick of the short battery life. This battery lasts much longer.
624,5,Purchased this during the holidays with that BOGO promotion. It's a nice upgrade to my current 6S. Really like the fast response and (Finally!) better camera quality. The glass color in the back is nicer than the previous versions too
625,4,"Great phone! It is a major upgrade from my 6s, but I think I could of gotten more on the trade in."
626,5,"I jumped and bought the iPhone X but returned it. I then got the iPhone 8 Plus and have no regrets. I compared the two and the only differences are the size, screen resolution and Face ID vs Fingerprint. All other features are identical."
627,5,bought 2 of them for my kids. The screen is so big I am jealous.
628,4,"I have recent experience using both the iPhone SE and iPhone 6s Plus. The Plus model was too big since I use a case with a belt clip to carry the phone, and the SE's screen was a bit too small. I am going to compare my review of the iPhone 8 (purchased unlocked at full price and used with Verizon prepaid) mostly to the iPhone 6s Plus, but one has to understand that the SE especially at prepaid price is an excellent, outstanding phone too with almost all of the same features as the Plus!) Pros: The iPhone 8 is an upgrade in a few ways. Apple includes a compare feature on its website so I won't go into all of the details, but I will try to address the ones that are upgrades to the iPhone 6s Plus. True Tone display does make the screen easier to read because the lighting isn't as harsh. This is coming from someone who has vision problems and prefers the ""daylight"" bulbs because I need good lighting to see. This phone features water resistance, which means one can now uses cases that might provide better protection or do not muffle sound. With that said, I use a Ghostek Nautical 2 case also sold through BestBuy. It provides great protection combined with waterproofing. Since I use hearing aids to stream audio, sound being muffled isn't an issue and people can hear me clearly. The camera specs *seem* to be similar, but I can see a difference! The pictures are clearer, sharper, and more detailed. Also, this smaller model has the optical image stabilization for the video too. To get the best quality video, I shoot in 4K even though the final output will be in 1080p. Larger files won't take up as much room on this model thanks to upgraded compression features. This model includes an improved flash too. The sound quality on the iPhone 8 seems to be louder and clearer. There is a front speaker too. With my previous phones I also used battery cases. The iPhone 8 with the same use seems to get me through the whole day, but I plan to buy an external battery charger that will also allow me to charge wirelessly soon. Neutral: The bluetooth is supposed to be an upgrade. I am not sure if this is a hardware of software issue with iOS 11 through 11.2.1. At the time of this writing, I am having some issues with it. With phone calls, my made for iPhone hearing aids do not work as well. Sometimes only one connects. Other times I notice a periodic static or crackling sound. Areas for Improvement: What I do not like about the IPhone 8 is the glass back because of how it is designed. In my opinion, it is a very poor design choice, and what weighted the most heavily on my decision to knock star off the overall rating. It is almost half of the cost of the phone without insurance to replace this! The iPhone 4s has a glass back too. However, one could remove two screws and slide off the back, which means the back plate and battery were easily replaced. A fast charging wall adapter was not included in this premium priced phone. I use a Belkin (also sold through BestBuy) or iPad one instead of the one included with great results. Without a case, the ""gold"" looks like rose gold around the edges and several shades lighter on the back. It looks expensive and stylish, but this look disappears with a case. I miss my Rose Gold that could be seen even through a clear back case. Comments: I didn't wait for the iPhone X. I think the technology behind the facial recognition features is impressive. However, without Touch ID too, I am willing to wait to see how this works out and will decide again when I upgrade next time. I would prefer the bigger iPhone screen on a smaller size. The built-in portrait features are a plus, but I can do most of that with software. These three differences were not worth the price difference to me. Overall Conclusion: I am enjoying using my IPhone 8 with improves on previous models, and it was the best overall choice for me."
629,1,"It's an apple product, what more can I day, I'm a Samsung guy, bought this junk for my wife cause that's what she wanted for Christmas"
630,5,"I have to wonder what may be the point of writing a review on a phone. The tribal mentality that is Android vs. iPhone has obfuscated any real discussion around fitting the right tool to function. Subjectively, and objectively as one can muster, it is redundant to say this is a beautiful functional top shelf device. The only thing I can offer to anyone on the fence is consider whether you are someone that ""needs"" your device... needs your phone to meld into the million parts of the daily kaleidoscope of your life, to find it's place in your own personal flurry.... or if you are someone that is buying the phone primarily as a daily fidget spinner of sorts; a electronic time killer to insulate the space between the minutes. To keep the walls warm between seasons. Neither of those are ill things, nor does one always find themselves only in summer flurries or wedded to the cruel mistress of hurry up and wait. Do you need your device, or does your device need you? The iPhone 8 is a stalwart servant to your court. Android is a small child, a forever needy fledgling. The rest is what you're made of."
631,5,This iPhone 8 has some really amazing features to it that I haven't even started to tap into. I'm sure if you want to bump up to this phone you too will totally satisfied with all the new updates and features.(FYI:Just remember the more new upgraded iPhones Apple puts out...your older iPhone will start to function incorrectly more and more) it's there way of getting you in to buy a newer iPhone.
632,4,Great phone. The designated mute button is a waste
633,3,Good product but kingmaker expensive hope it works
634,4,Is very nice product iPhone 8 The cámara is very good
635,4,Still getting some of it down but really like the screen and the size. Have arthritis in my hands and the bigger ones are more difficult to hold.
636,5,My boyfriend loves the big screen to watch his videos on and play games on.
637,3,Lightweight with gorilla glass! It’s about time. I finally have a decent Apple phone.
638,5,Phone is fast and reliable. Feels great in your hand!11
639,5,"Best iPhone yet. Upgraded from a 6 plus and couldn't believe how much more this phone had to offer! The photos are amazing, wifi has definitely improved and the new functions of iOS that would make my previous phone lock up are super fun to use!"
640,5,"Was a tough choice between the 8+ and the X, but I went with this one and am not disappointed. Still getting used to the new features but it's a solid product."
641,5,This is my second iPhone purchased from Best Buy and it is the Greatest brand!!
642,5,Upgraded to stay current with the technology. The phone works great.
643,4,To me it’s another iPhone but I suppose it’s got some cool new features I love How streamlined it is with my MacBook regarding documents and the cloud etc

645,5,Great phone! Love the ease of use of my iPhone 8 and camera is amazing as Apple does a great job of making their phones easy to use and just beautiful to look at!

647,5,"I upgraded from a 6+. Not that different, but it is faster"
648,5,"Best iPhone yet, totally satisfied and could not be better"
649,1,Not a fan of the iPhone after I bought this one going back to Samsung
650,5,I upgraded from a Samsung S7 to this Iphone and I wish I had done it earlier. The battery life is well beyond my expectations and the phone itself is very responsive.
651,5,Thank you for helping me shoose my product I will recommend you guys.
652,5,My daughter has no complaints on it. She loves it with no glitches noted.
653,2,"No one warned me that this Phone was set to automatically connect to data any time it judged the wifi was poor, so I was surprised when I started getting text messages about going over my data limit when I thought I was on my home wifi. The only thing that changed was my phone. Wish Verizon had given me a heads-up on this."
654,5,Bought for my wife as a gift hope she likes it! Great iPhone
655,5,"Still playing around with it, buido far so good..."
656,4,It is very nice unlocked phone I neve to have before.

661,5,Thanks to Best Buy great costumer service thanks..
662,5,"Holds up to the expectations I have of iPhone so far! I had my 5, and 6s plus both for 2 years and never had any functionality, battery life, or any issues from them. They were in perfect condition when I upgraded. Hoping for the same with this one!"
663,5,Its an Apple. Be aware that ordering on line means the store won't help in set up-it's all you.
664,4,Bought a new iPhone for my son and took advantage of e BOGO deal. Best Buy Rep was great providing pricing and program options to help us the biggest bang for the buck.
665,4,Great phone so far! Only negative is no 3.5 auxiliary cable input. You have to use the stupid lightning cable
666,5,Great product. Easy installation. Highly recommend.
667,4,Apple stayed consistent with this model. It’s not flashy but they upgraded some features on iOS that catch up with some cool Android features.
668,5,Better than expected. So many features and upgrades from my old iPhone 5. Definitely needed a new device.
669,5,I love the advances to the camera! Rhe wireless charging is so convenient
670,5,There hasn’t been any issues and I believe it was worth the price and plan
671,5,Costly but worth it. Works fine and with updates with bugs are gone .
672,5,Bought it for my daughter for Christmas. Have had an iPhone for many years so it was an easy decision to get her a newer one! They are so easy to use and have so many great features!!
673,5,I never have to worry about having too many photos or videos on my phone anymore with all the space on my new iPhone 8!! I love everything about this phone!
674,5,Got this one for my hubby for Christmas. Have had an iPhone for many years so it was an easy decision to get another newer one! They are so easy to use and have so many great features!!
675,5,Have had an iPhone for many years so it was an easy decision to get another newer one! They are so easy to use and have so many great features!!
676,5,Great Phone IPhone has never disappointed me camera is great
677,5,"I have always had android phones, and in fact had just upgraded to the Samsung galaxy s8+, but decided to return it and give the iPhone 8+a try. There is a bit of a learning curve involved, but now that I have figured things out I love this phone and am glad I made the switch. I appreciate the easy functionality and integration with my other Apple products."
678,4,The best I phone I have had and cheaper then the x and alimony every option
679,5,Better than my 6s. Prior to getting this phone I was sure that then6s was the best phone. 8 plus is now my favorite.
680,5,Bought this for my daughter for her birthday. Love the new features of the iPhone 8.
681,5,I ended up getting the iPhone 8 over the X. I figured the 8 was basically just as good and since I was buying it out right it was a lot cheaper.
682,5,My daughter loves this phone & it’s features!! It is a great Phone!!
683,5,This phone is amazing!!! I love the size of this phone & it’s features!!
684,5,"Love the iPhone 8! Coming from the 7, is by far the fastest iPhone yet, I wish I had gone with the x though just to change things up, but the 8 is amazing just my personal preference"
685,5,"I have been using Samsung for the last 6 years, I like this mobile very much"
686,5,"Again I'm an android fan and my wife isn't so upon her inspection, she raves about this phone."
687,5,"My old iPhone 6s was doing fine till I absolutely obliterated it. The reviews of the 8 were good enough so I went with 8 vs the 10 and saved a small amount of $$. Surprisingly the reviews of the 10 were less than desirable - another reason to pick the 8. It has performed flawlessly so far and is quite a lot like my old 6s, just a little faster. Good phone, recommended"
688,4,"This is a great phone, pricey but worth it. Great camera quality and storage."
689,4,iPhone 8 is not a big upgrade to iPhone 7. I would recommend iPhone X to a 8 because the screen size is small for a similar size phone and Touch ID is a challenge for recognition.
690,5,I have always been an Apple product fan and this purchase supported that.
691,5,So far so good. Bought for 18 year old boy. He like it so far
692,5,"Does everything I need it to do. Takes amazing pictures, is fast, etc. Great upgrade from the iPhone 6."
693,5,Glad we did the upgrade. Definitely faster than my previous iPhone.
694,5,"Quick and efficient, just as I hoped. Happy with my decision to upgrade!"
695,5,Awesome camera. It take pictures just like one of the expensive ones.
696,5,"Had a pleasant experience upgrading my phone at Best Buy. The salesman was professional, polite and courteous."
697,5,What can I say? It’s an iPhone. It works great and I am impressed with it. I haven’t had any problems or negatives to report.
698,5,This feature on the phone a better look; easy to operate the bar;
699,5,I love the iPhone 8! It is the best yet. Battery life lasts much longer and the screen is super clear.
700,5,Great phone! Happy with it so far. Best Buy is the best place to get phones by far!!
701,5,Great phone! Happy with it so far. Best Buy is the best place to get phones by far!!
702,5,What more to say. Apple I Phone 8. It is all that I expected and more. Thousands of positive reviews say it much better than me. I am not not a techno person but I find it easy to use and love it.
703,5,Apple continues to create great product. Very pleased with this device
704,4,"8 plus is large- almost too large, close to being a tablet on your ear."
705,4,Still subtle in color when placed in a protective case.
706,5,Love the size of it so easy to see and as always Apple is the best
707,4,"the 8 is an extension of all other iphones similar in function, this is a large phone takes a bit to get used to"
708,5,It is way cheaper than the iphone x but better than the 7.
709,4,definitely recommend. nice upgrade from the 6s plus
710,5,Daughter loves it. Awesome camera and fast internet.
711,5,"I found that my old iPhone wasn't keeping up to what I was used to so when Verizon came out with a rebate, I took advantage."
712,1,"I have been an IPhone user since day one, this will be my last. The phone is not user friendly at all and Transfer medium has gotten to the point that if you didn't buy it from them, you can't transfer it over from a previous phone. All ring tones sound the same and are made for kids, the phone is outrageously expensive and I relate to an automobile that when you need an oil change, you buy a new car unlike many of the other brands out there that can update and accessorize easier. I waited at the store for 3 hours only to be told that my texts, pictures, self added music and ringtones could not be transferred and that the newer tranfering medium does not allow that, everything on the new one cost $$. In addition during working out details my account has now changed without my authorization to a different plan. Phone also keeps pestering you and trying to trick you into 2 factor authentification and once you do it, you need to change you passwords to get rid of it although you didn't want it in the first place. Well now I know better for next time!"
713,4,Camera is great and the screen has crisp quality. Same size as a 7 plus but better aspects.
714,5,"Large screen, easily handled, fast, once you go apple you can’t go back"
715,1,you will only post positive reviews so why ask for them. Stop emailing me
716,2,This phone is basically the same as the 6 version. I had no issues with the 6 except the battery life so I got the 8. Now I cant connect to Blue tooth in my car or my blue tooth ear phones. Should have just replaced the battery in my 6. And this phone is way over priced!!! May try a Samsung next time!!
717,1,Two days after upgrading from iPhone 6 I learn that it is true that Apple slowed my phone. I believe they did this to frustrate me into paying for an expensive upgrade. I would have switched to Samsung if I had known this. Next time...
718,5,This phone is better than I expected. The speakers are good and the camera quality and zoom are great.
719,5,"Best Buy reps did a great job to upgrade my cellphone, transfer data and complete the transaction in a timely manner"
720,5,"I was torn between the 8+ and the 10. Ultimately I decided on the 8+, and am really happy with what it has to offer. The pictures are fantastic- clear as day. Great phone!"
721,5,Love love this phone!!! I would tell everyone about it
722,5,It’s a Christmas gift for my daughter but I have the 8+ and I love everything about it. I’m quite sure she will love it because she moving up from a 6s to an 8.
723,4,It’s an iPhone. It’s not much different than my last iPhone except it runs the latest iOS without having to worry about Apple’s intentional slow-down yet. I like the Plus- my last phone was standard size and I really love the larger screen. But it’s heavy. Sometimes the phone stops responding to touch screen for no apparent reason. This is concerning. And I may bring it up with Apple Support after a little google research. Overall - it’s really OK. It’s a good phone but probably not much better than any other good smart phone.
724,5,The camera is much better and my area of TX can get dusty quite often so I will really enjoy the dust resistance.
725,5,Another great phone from Apple. It feels a little lighter and I enjoy the larger screen of the Plus.
726,5,Got this on the buy one get one promotion with AT&T. My wife loves it.
727,5,"I needed to upgrade from my 6. I didn't care to spend the extra 300 for the X. This phone is just fine, and didn't take an time at all to learn the new features."
728,5,Great phone and great all around features at what is a reasonable price in today’s world
729,4,I really like the phone. Really not all that different from the 6 but a lot more upgrades.
730,5,I love my phone it works great it is upgrades in the lot faster than my 6+ thanks
731,5,Good phone. It’s quick and has good storage for me probably too big for someone with small hands
732,5,the new I phone 8 is much clear photos and battery life lasts longer. the size is a litter larger and all apps much clearer
733,5,Love how easy it is to get a new phone at Best Buy. Walk in tell them what I want and walk out with my phone all set to use. Love the service and how much knowledge the workers have about the phone plans and phones.
734,4,I have had an iPhone 5 for years and it was time to upgrade. This phone works well and updates some of the problems I had with the 5. The 5 was a great device for the time but was not a great phone. Sound quality was poor. The 8 sounds much better.
735,5,Phone is a nice upgrade without the large pricetag
736,5,The portrait setting on the camera for the iPhone 8 Plus takes wonderful pictures. Very pleased so far
737,5,One of my favorite things about the new IPhone 8 Plus is the camera settings. Fabulous!
738,5,"Great phone, love the new features. Love the color"
739,5,"Easy to operate, easy to read, very happy! Going from a Galaxy S6 to the iPhone 8 Plus was a great decision for my husband. It's a good size phone especially in the otter box for his big hands and the print is large enough to see without his glasses. He's been transformed to an ""i"" guy!"
740,5,Great iPhone with lots of memory. The fastest iPhone so far.
741,5,My best cell phone so far. The camera is great and with a lot of memory space. The new IOS is perfect for this new iPhone.
742,5,Great upgrade love the camera and the speed for the internet
743,5,I've had every iPhone since the 3GS. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. It looks amazing and works flawlessly. Very fast and never had any issues.
744,5,Me and my wife bought an iPhone a piece we got the best service from Bestbuy and the iPhones work great.we bought them for Christmas for each other.there are so many features to these phones I’m still working thru all of them thank you for all your help when we picked them out.
745,5,"Switched to apple from android. great experience ,easy to use and the camera is just awesome."
746,4,This classic iPhone is great for the price Great camera
747,5,"I wasn't sure that I wanted to upgrade to a new phone, but I actually like the iPhone 8. The only thing that I’m not sure about is having to use an adapter for headphones."
748,5,I like my new iPhone it runs much quicker than my iPhone 6
749,4,"Can be slow at times, should be fixed with next update"
750,5,I love my iPhone 8 the futures are great and You always get great deals at Best Buy
751,5,This phone is the best iPhone yet! Very fast processor makes opening apps and websites a joy
752,5,My son loves his new phone. He said its the best iphone yet.
753,5,It’s a IPhone not much to say. Great phone easy to use.
754,5,Loving my new iPhone. It's been many years of using androids and I always thought they were the best - but after having this for just a couple months I am SO glad to have made the switch. Usability is intuitive and camera quality is amazing - especially in portrait mode. The Apple wallet is convenient. Love this purchase.
755,5,"Enjoying the larger sized Plus, many useful features and a great camera!"
756,5,"I love my new phone. I upgraded from the 6 to the 8 plus . I was afraid of the size , but now I LOVE it!"
757,5,This iPhone 8 is by far the best iPhone I have owned. Plus the wireless charging is an amazing convenience with super quick charge ups.
758,5,I purchase this for my mom.. bestbuy had amazing deal got the phone free great camera and very fast
759,5,"Love my new iphone8. Perfect size to fit into my old case that I love, OS11 works great with it. And service by Best Buy made my purchase easy and quick"
760,5,"Another great phone from Apple. It is fast, clear photos and looks great with the glass back."
761,4,"This phone is a lot larger than the previous models. The camera quality is excellent. However, the battery is starting to loose charge and I need to take it in."
762,5,"Awesome phone, but charging battery is slow, fantastic camera And operates extremely fast"
763,5,The best part of this purchase was the help I received from the employees.
764,5,"the latest phone from Apple is better than its predecessors yet again. faster, easier to use, and everything you would expect from Apple"
765,5,Love it. Had a 6 plus. Skipped 7 and went straight to 8
766,5,Upgraded from 6s+. Worth the upgrade. Home button was weird at first but now I like it even more than the actual button on the 6 and other previous models. Battery lasts quite a while.
767,5,Works great. Happy with my purchase. Got it in space grey.
768,3,"This is the first iPhone I have ever owned. I am normally an android user but I needed a new phone and there was nothing android out that was interesting to me. Pros of the IPhone 8 -the sound is pretty good -the standby time for the battery feels like forever -I really like the fingerprint scanner -Other than the average white front, the glass finish on the back is actually quite luxurious Cons -The battery seems to drain quick when in use -You have to buy all those extra pieces for fast charging -No back button and menu area on the touchscreen like the android -You can’t customize anything other than basic contributions All in all. The IPhone 8 is pretty alright. I’ll probably honestly go back to android unless Apple owes me with the IPhone X 2"
769,5,"The 21 year old female loves it! What else can you expect out of Apple? As for me, it's too large."
770,2,"I just recently got the iPhone 8, went in because of the boho special with att. See no difference in the technology than the 7. As. Matter of fact the speaker volume is horrible and the ringer is low. Would save my money I was you"
771,5,Bought for daughter! She had a 7plus and she love this one although it isn’t the color she preferred!
772,5,The phone quality is good. The photos look great. I’m glad I upgraded.
773,5,I love my new Iphone 8+ is fast and still has the home button I'd be lost without it. The speakers are great i don't need to use a bluetooth speaker most of the time. I really like the portrait feature.
774,5,Apple update killed my battery on my 6s Plus. Upgraded to 8 plus and its worth the investment.
775,5,Love this new phone and love the new look of this phone 8
776,5,My 4th iPhone. Love it!! I really like the bigger screen if the 8 plus. Even fits in my old case. Would recommend
777,5,The salesperson was very knowledgeable & helpful..
778,4,"Slightly faster, more storage ,better battery life miss seoerate head phone jack"
779,5,Switching from a iPhone 6plus to a iPhone 8 Plus was a great choice. It the size of the phones are similar the camera is awesome!!
780,5,Really elegant looking phone. Impressive. Got it as present for wife.
781,4,I got this phone for my wife. Its the iPhone 8... what else do i have to say. The specs have been virtually the same for the last 3 iPhones. So there is nothing really special about this one. Its nice and sleek like most Apple products. Best Buy had $100 so I decided it was the best deal at the time. But the box came unsealed so I took off one star for that!
782,5,"My first iPhone since the 3GS. I got away from them awhile, but now I'm back for good!"
783,5,"The BulletShield material on the exterior offers impact protection in falls up to 6.6 feet, and its thin and lightweight profile doesn't add extra bulk. This Tech21 case resists yellowing and has a scratch-resistant finish."
784,5,It’s an iPhone 8 what’s not to love. It can fit into iPhone 8 cases which makes it so convenient!
785,5,The size and function of the iPhone 8 Plus is extremely good
786,5,"Love my new iPhone ! It works perfectly. Has a fantastic battery life, great camera, and tons of memory."
787,4,"I love the new camera, and how clear the new screen is. I would recommend this phone to everyone."
788,5,Love my iPhone 8. Definitely recommended to friends and family.
789,4,My boys are the I Phone users and they're always trying to convince me that I should switch from Android. I have to admit iPhone seems to be very simple to navigate. It may be that they convince me at some point to change from Android.
790,5,"Love this phone....went from android to iphone, glad i did."
791,5,Love the sleek design and easy use of the phone. The camera upgrade is excellent and takes amazing pictures with ease!
792,5,Love love love love this phone...very easy to use!
793,5,"It does what it’s supposed to do and I like it, I’d buy it again"
794,5,What more do you expect? It’s a great phone and does what I expect it to.
795,5,Tried the latest Samsung but was underwhelmed! Just don’t like the operating system as everyone in family has iPhones. Left me out on many group messages & iMessages. Back to normal again and am impressed with the better speeds & camera!
796,5,The camera alone is worth the 5 stars! The customer service clerk was top notch!
797,5,I’m enjoying my new iPhone so far. Really didn’t want to get rid of my 6.
798,5,"I love this phone. No complaints at all!! The glass back and front scares me a lottle, but I will make sure to keep a screen protector case on it."
799,5,"My son got this phone and he absolutely loves it. The phone is sleek, easy to handle, and powerful. The camera alone makes it worth an upgrade."
800,5,Baught for my nephew. Loves the phone and excited that he got one.
801,5,My niece loves her phone. I never seen her happier to receive a gift
802,5,It’s too fast. I am enjoyed the fact it’s fast and quick to open.
803,5,I traded up from an iPhone 6 to the 8 plus. The larger screen makes for easier reading and typing. I love the camera and viewing my pictures on a larger screen.
804,4,"So far phone is working good, upgraded from iPhone 5. Did have some issues with Fitbit device syncing, deleted app and device then reinstalled ... so far so good"
805,5,Bought two of them. One move from android and one upgraded from 5S.
806,5,Thanks for the opportunity to review this phone. My son loves it
807,5,"Upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8, and I’m glad I did. Love the color too!"
808,5,This is my first iPhone Plus and I love the big screen
809,5,"I was just use to my 7+, so I decided to go with the 8+. Saved a little bit because it also fits my cases."
810,5,Charges really fast. Great camera. Other than that I do t notice much of a difference from the 6plus
811,5,"great phone ,much better than my old Samsung galaxy s6"
812,5,"Honestly it’s a great phone. Coming from a 6+, this phone is superb and well worth the upgrade. The white coloring is actually kinda grey on the back which is different than former models. Super happy with this phone!"

814,5,Upgraded from a 6S Plus. The speed and fluidity are night and day different. This thing is fast and smooth.

843,5,Works good and battery life is longer. The brighter is also good
844,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 8 Plus and I am amazed at the difference. Absolutely worth it!
845,5,"I upgraded to this phone from an iPhone 6S and to be honest,I don't notice a ton of difference in features or performance. The camera is great,and I really like the PLUS size. I did not really feel like forking over the extra money for the X...so the 8 Plus fit the bill. Some might wonder if it is too big...the only time it becomes an issue is in the car. It does not easily fit in the center console or cup holder very well, but no problems in front pocket. What else is there to say.....it is an iPhone...and they have always been good."
846,5,It works what more could you honestly ask for ?!?!
847,5,"Easy to use, seems like Apple is kinda lagging on upgrades from model to model"
848,5,"Excellent screen resolution, camera is awesome. Definitely a great Apple product."
849,4,"This is a great phone, I am so glad that I didn't jump to get the iPhone X and spend even more money. But the touch ID is very sensitive causing my phone to light up often probably losing battery. Other than that it is great. Only annoyance is with the iOS updates but that is an Apple feature"
850,4,Love the new camera/photo options but have to say this is a very fragile and easily scratchable. More so than older iPhones
851,5,It’s an iPhone it’s great just like all predecessors. Even better because it was free when I upgraded another phone at the same time

857,5,It is so easy to use and the images are so sharp. Love the written call messaged
