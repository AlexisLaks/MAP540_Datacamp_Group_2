0,4,Awesome phone.. but need the screen a bit bigger..
1,5,I love this phone. Don’t miss the home button one bit.
2,5,But I really love it. I used to have a 6s plus because I like a bigger screen. This screen is just as big but the phone is not! Perfect
3,5,I bought the iPhone X for my wife and she loves it. The screen is beautiful. The camera is stunning and the facial scanner is next level!
4,5,"Love this phone it works great, it’s an iPhone :)!!"
5,5,Best iPhone yet. Love the facial recognition and long lasting battery
6,4,Love the phone and it’s upgrades however it is so fragile and difficult to find a minimalist drip proof cover to cover all of the front screen including over the raised glass (fragile) to meet where the screen saver ends. I don’t know why Apple chose to design it this way. Also as it is made of glass on front and back I would think more of the aforementioned cases would be available but they are not. I used to love Tech 21 but they don’t fit bc of the front screen design. Also it is so small I have difficulty locating it esp in my purse after using my Uphone 6SPlus and I wish they offered it in the Rose Gold color.
7,5,Amazing pictures! Love the phone
8,5,Just upgraded from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone X and I’m glad I did. Phone is great and I love the fact that it is a little different but still an iPhone. I’ve had the iPhones 4-7. I hated the home button so this is a plus for me! Also love the Face ID! No regrets here!
9,5,"Waited to get it and it was so worth it. The store in Henrietta,NY is the best"
10,5,Wonderful camera and excellent size. Truly water proof he uses his music in shower!
11,5,"This was my Christmas gift to me. Big clear screen. Great camera, amazing Apple quality."
12,4,I got my model x with 256 gb phone 3 weeks ago and I liked this phone so far in terms of performance and easiness. As normal apple did a good job with this new model. I usually don’t write the reviews but this is the first time I am writing a review after 10 years. This is my Frank assessment on iPhone model x.you will not be disappointed with this buy.
13,5,excellent wireless telephone great quality picture
14,5,Once again Apple hits it out of the park with an iPhone!
15,5,"After having various iPhone models since 2007, I was pleasantly surprised by the iPhone X. I really like that this phone does not have a home button and that it has face recognition that works well. The phone is very fast also. Overall, I really think Apple did a great job on this phone and I have no regrets over what I originally considered to be a big expense for a phone."
16,5,I live my IPhone X! I’m so glad I did this purchase! It’s sleek and smart!
17,5,"This iPhone was a gift for my daughter, who is a Freshmen in High School....& she has not put it down since Christmas.....It's a great phone & great for HULU also!!!"
18,5,"It's the latest,and greatest from Apple. My wife loves it."
19,5,"Great camera, easy to use and I would recommend this to anyone who looking for a upgrade"
20,5,I love the IPhone X. Camera is incredible and a full screen with very small border is great. No more home button that’s replaced with a quick swipe & easy to get used to.
21,5,nice phone and very fast apps. the screen is way bigger than the 7 or 8 and super fast
22,5,Bought this phone for my wife or Christmas and she loves it. Super fast and screen is amazing. Face ID feature works flawlessly too.
23,5,Upgraded my IPhone from 5S to X. Could not be happier. The 10 is great!
24,4,"I have owned almost every generation of iPhone and this has the best battery and screen resolution by far. However, I miss the thumbprint security features compared to the Face ID. Face ID will not work unless you’re looking at the screen and this is a hassle if you want to glance at your screen without actually looking directly at it. It also will not work if my eyes are closed or my face is partially covered."
25,3,Not really sure why it cost so much more than the seven or eight camera quality seems to be the same as seven and eight a bit pricey
26,5,I loved my 6plus but the X is even better. Processing is quicker.
27,4,"I wouldn't say this phone is a game changer but it's okay. It has issues with face recognition and the pulling apps from the bottom up is a bit of a pain when it doesn't work. The clarity is nice and the camera is great but overall I would just say it's the latest apple phone and give it an ""Ok"""
28,5,This phone was easy to use and the camera is unmatched.
29,5,Size is just about perfect. Love the screen and Face ID
30,5,iPhone X is great. Very happy with it. I don't notice the notch as much as other reviews say because the screen is huge. I rarely use it in landscape mode as well. Happy camper.
31,5,Thanks honey I have to do a good job and working on my house today
32,5,"Face ID works great and you won’t miss the home button after a few new gestures become second nature. Apple finally made the phone a blonde one thicker to put a battery (actually 2 batteries) in that lasts all day! The X gives you the screen size of a Plus in a form factor that fits easily in your pocket. If you are going to spend the money on a flagship phone, this should be the one you buy."
33,5,"Great phone! Everything that advertisements had promised. Fast with a beautiful display, and a really high quality camera."
34,5,Bought it as a Christmas gift and the person loved it.
35,4,"I like the total size of this, always felt my plus was just too big so the X is great since it’s smaller but the screen is Larger than the plus. Having no home button took getting used to and sometimes it’s annoying the the face lock doesn’t work if your laying down. If the latest tech isn’t a big priority for you I would get this. The price of it is NOT justified by the new features, although the battery life of it is great, like really great. Lasts me till bed time and I take it off the charger around 6am every day"
36,5,Upgrade my iPhone 6 to the iPhoneX and its such a big difference!! Great pictures and very fast running.
37,5,"The iphone x is awesome. I really like the face recognition. In my opinion, it is better than the finger print and quicker, especially if you are holding other things."
38,5,"Yes, the price is high... but the phone performs beautifully and the screen is amazing!"
39,5,I thought I would struggle without the home button but I got use to it within 2 minutes. Love this phone.
40,5,"It’s difficult to put in words,The Intuitive Comfortability and Amazing Hands On Experience of the iPhone X - An Absolute Marvel....!"
41,5,Apple finally gave us something different and this phone is a beast.
42,5,I’ve had about every iPhone since the 3GS days and this is def the best one yet! It was def time for a refresh in design and this is the best device for one handed use with a 5.8 inch screen I’ve seen yet!
43,5,"Never had a Apple device, won’t ever go back to galaxy"
44,5,Camera is amazing but charging is slooooooooooooow.
45,5,My wife and I both upgraded our phones to the iPhone X. I switched back to iPhone from a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and am very happy. The screen is bigger than on my S7 edge but the phone is smaller. The lack of a home button is easy to get used to and the facial ID for security is great!
46,5,"This phone lives up to all I expected and more. I am still exploring what all it does, but at this point I am very pleased. It is quick, the screens are crisp & clear, the sounds very nice. A great jump up from my iPhone5."
47,4,"Very nice, new design, bigger screen and face recognition technology."
48,5,Upgraded from the 7 to the X and this is so a cool phone. Features are amazing.
50,5,So far so good. No problems as of yet. Everything works as it should
51,5,Upgraded to the X from a six. Have to get used to the new features and not having a home button. But works well. Camera is an upgrade.
52,4,Awesome screen.awesome camera.the best iPhone yet.
53,5,iPhoneX 256 gb is by far my favorite iPhone to date. It was easy to adjust to the new gestures right away and had no problem at all with transitioning away from the classic home button as many fear. I highly recommend iPhoneX 256 to anyone.
54,1,the battery life is very bad and regret buying it.
55,5,I love my new iphone x it is better than I could asked for.
56,5,Best Buy was great in getting the phone set up and explaining the basics on how it works! Love the phone. It didn't take long to get use to the new features! I actually find them to be very user friendly.
57,5,I love this pretty iPhone design but I wish Apple make screen a little bit bigger.
58,5,"It’s basically a more badass iPhone than the previous models. You want the latest and greatest, get the iPhone X. Face ID is just one of the many features that I personally love."
59,5,"I love the phone, the features I am still learning how to navigate but not much difference. The transfer of data was so easy, it was amazing. The whole face recognition, i love that to unlock the phone. Looking forward to what else this phone can do."
60,3,"It will be a good phone soon, but as off now ? Not so much"
61,4,"Drop calls, hard to learn! Do love the bigger screen though. I’d wait a few months"
62,4,"The phone is very polished, although many functions have changed. It does take some getting used to!"
63,3,"good phone. although i wish they didnt get rid of fingerprint scanner. also once the phone is unlocked it should take me straight to the home screen, instead i have to press the screen again."
64,5,The best iPhone I am glad I made the switch fast pictures are great love it.
65,5,Great phone upgraded from the 6 easy to use have to get adjusted to having no home button
66,5,I love it this phone its very nice
67,5,I’m totally in love with this iPhone X
68,5,great phone. face id is awesome and i do like not having the home button
69,3,Very small phone. Nice display (aside from the stupid notch). Battery life not great. Lack of home button was awful. I felt like it was extra steps just to close apps. Good camera.
70,5,"Love the speed and camera on this phone, a solid upgrade over previous model"
71,4,Got this phone for my daughter and she likes the size better then the 7 Plus that she had. This one is right in between the regular size and plus size. She also says the screen is really nice and seems better then her old phone. She still wishes she could charge the phone and plug in headphones at the same time though.
72,5,I have had the last 7 iPhones and this is the first time I was like wow what a difference. The screen is gorgeous and having no home button makes this I one handed phone. Love it
73,5,"This phone is just fabulous. I don't miss the home button at all. The facial recognition doesn't work as perfectly as I had hoped, but I am still giving it 5 stars. You just have to be sure the phone is held up and aimed right at your face. I feel it is highly over priced really, but then again, it is a great product. I wouldn't consider any other phone but an iPhone."
74,5,Great phone ever best result best speed and awsm look
75,2,"The swipe down from upper right of the screen is the main change i don't appreciate. The volume in maximum mode is WAY too loud. I have anxiety and jump when my phone goes off if its at max volume. The change from ""Wednesday"" to ""Wed"" on the calendar app icon is not necessary. And why isn't there an AM or PM for the time while I'm in the phone? The absence of a headphone jack is depressing."
76,5,"Didn’t think that I would like this phone when I first got it but I so love it now. Still getting use to the size. Much small than my IPhone6s plus,"
77,5,I didn't know how fast and easy to use could be until I had used this phone for a couple of weeks. Really like it!
78,4,"I have been an iPhone user since the first iPhone. I purchased this phone about an month ago and am still getting used to some of the new ways it works. I am very happy with the camera. It does well in low light and the quality of the pictures in general is outstanding. Although the phone covers most of the screen, I still find it smaller than the 6s I upgraded from. Facial recognition is a feature I really like. Swiping is talking me a little bit of time to get used to and I like it although it seems cumbersome when you want to fully close out an app. The method requires swiping up and stopping in the middle of the screen, then holding until a red -- appears in the corner of the app. You then have to click on the red -- to close each particular app. Overall, I like the phone but mainly because of the camera quality."
79,5,Best phone I ever owned by far the camera is incredible and Face ID is just genius.
80,5,"Love the new iPhone, I love the sleek design and the ease of use."
81,5,"Absolutely love it. Takes amazing photos in portrait mode. Screen is the best one Apple has produced to date, you have to see it to really appreciate how good it is. Love the fact that the footprint of the phone is barely bigger than a 6/7/8 but screen is bigger than the 6/7/8 plus."
82,5,"Its a great phone, i thought the notch would bother me but since i don't watch videos on it its fine. Little on the expansive side but its worth it."
83,5,Nice phone--it's always nice to upgrade and get the improved camera and features.
84,5,I upgraded from the iPhone 6s Plus. So far the battery is fantastic the speed is second to none. I I was skeptical about the facial unlock verses the fingerprint but I have to say I prefer the facial unlock over the fingerprint. No need to worry about taking your gloves off in the winter to unlock your iPhone! It’s amazing and I would highly recommend it.
85,5,Best camera in the market by far thanks mike for you help
86,3,Our son really likes this phone larger screen. Takes great pics
87,4,Not too much different from the plus iPhone. Bigger screen
88,5,"So many great things about iPhone X. I debated upgrading, but am so glad that I did. I’d recommend this phone to anyone who is looking to upgrade or switch from an android."
89,5,I like the iPhone X. I came from using an iPhone 6 16gb that was recently plagued by the apple update “slow down”. Nice phone operates well. Good camera.
90,5,"The Screen looks amazing, it’s much faster than my iPhone 7, great phone."
91,1,"The phone is larger than all previous iphones, however the screen is more narrow. When I watch landscape video, the screen size expands until it either hits the top and bottom, or the sides, or both (this is normal function), in landscape the video expands until it hits top and bottom and leaves over a 1/2"" of dead screen on each side. this means I am looking at a screen the same size as an old iphone 3 or something. it really really stinks. the narrow screen and resultant small landscape video size is a deal breaker. they can have it back. everyone I show this to is stunned."
92,5,"This phone is all you have come to expect from Apple. It’s all about the screen and it takes great photos too, which was important to me. MYER staff went over and above to get this phone to me from interstate in a matter of days. Very happy customer :-)"
93,5,"firstly, it looks superb (as you'd hope for this much £), but the functionality is brilliantly as well. The lack of home button took all of a few goes to get used to and the facial recognition works very well - added quirks such as keeping your lock screen notifications confidential until it see's your face are impressive. obviously this is a huge amount to fork out on a phone but i expect this to be an investment for the next 4 years or so."
94,5,I love the new iPhone X. It has facial recognition and lots of other cool functions that are not available on the other iPhones. I have also discovered some apps that are specifically for the iPhone X. I have noticed the battery life is great.
95,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE my new phone. Upgraded from the iPhone 6 Plus 64gb to the iPhone X 256gb. Love the face ID. Took about 2 days to get fully used to not having a home button anymore.
96,5,"I’ve always been an iPhone guy Pretty much had an iPhone all the way through the 6. This one though (the X) is awesome The camera alone is on point. No more home button though, but like my boy Forest said “One less thang”. I love it."
97,5,I’ve only owned the phone for a week and so far so good. The camera on the phone is a big step up from my 6s and there is a very noticeable improvement in battery life.
98,4,"I think for the price that you pay for the phone, Apple in my opinion did not change much to warrant the excessive amount that they want to purchase the phone. I should have just got the iPhone 8 or 7."
99,1,Not happy with iPhone X and setup
100,5,The new iPhone X is more just a great phone. AT&T paired with the iPhone X it almost like the two are a step ahead and ready for your next need.
101,5,Been an iPhone user since the beginning and now it’s even better than before. Enjoying the new features and cool gadgets that it came with. Worth the purchase.
102,5,Not a bad phone. New faceid needs to be improved. Display are good. My wife wanna a bigger screen.
103,2,I’m surprised it didn’t have better features. I switched from the galaxy s8 to the iPhone X and the galaxy had bed features and was way more customizable.
104,4,"I will start by saying I have been a user of the iPhone since iPhone 4. I have upgraded every year. That said, the X is the best looking iPhone yet by far. It does crush the competition. HOWEVER, I feel APPLE released this phone too early and there aren't many advantages to purchasing this phone over the normal 8/8 plus. In fact, I am returning my X very soon. Why? The big sell on the X is the facial recognition/technology in the forward facing camera. When looking at the screen, the picture quality is improved. The studio lighting mode is also a great feature! really neat, yet underdeveloped. Depending on your lighting in the room, this isn't the best, could have been better. Further, the OLED screen is intense! It is amazing clarity, however, many apps including youtube, Facebook, and Nest, etc. haven't updated their (video or photo) screen size to fit the phone fully yet. What I mean by that is, some apps wont come around until probably 6 months into the process. As to facebook and youtube, the resolution is exactly the same so why have it if you cant utilize it 100 percent of the time. Furthermore, I just found out they are releasing an X plus this year. By that time, it will be more perfected. I think I will wait for some improvements. Again, not a bad phone by any stretch, but the same processor, same camera, similar battery, same wireless charging, and they CHANGED THE HOME BUTTON>>>> frustrating....anyway....hope this helps someone."
105,3,Processor sucks after a week
106,5,The new iPhone X is a beautiful clean bright design. The new display is gorgeous. The new functions are intuitive. Battery much better.
107,5,"I was hesitant about spending the money for the X, but figured I use my phone more than any other device in life, so might as well splurge. This thing is fantastic. The facial recognition log in is excellent - I don't even think about the phone pulling up at all any more. It just opens. Battery life is excellent as well as speed. Good job Apple and good deal Best Buy."
108,5,The is a very nice phone and im glad I upgraded.. camera and battery life is great but i do feel my phone service and internet is slow
109,5,I am enjoying this new phone. The safety features of the facial recognition is truly awesome. I highly recommend purchasing this one.
110,5,It’s a awesome phone lot you can do with it fun time
111,1,Not happy with the polity of the phone and what its potential shielding the hype is over ratef
112,5,I purchased the IPhone X and an IPad. That was the best deal ever. I walked away with not only my IPhone but also an IPad which is what I had been wanting for a while now. I love it
113,5,Simply amazed with my iphone x battery life is amazing smooth running and just in awe
114,5,I love my IphoneX ! I think its the best investment I have made.
115,5,Excellent product and It easy to used it
116,5,Excellent product and easy to used it
117,5,I love it! The phone picture quality is so awesome.
118,2,I am going to return it and get the 8 the only difference about this phone is the home button is gone and the facial recognition. Since I am use to the the Plus this phone is also too small.
119,5,I absolutely love my iPhone X. It’s the best iPhone yet!
120,5,"So far I’m pleased with my phone, display and features."
121,3,the brightness is terrible. Not light enough
122,5,I love it!!! Love the camera.
123,5,Best upgrade to the iPhone X! Face recognition is fantastic. Best screen and audio of any iPhone!
124,5,I usually don't write reviews and how this helps someone out. I've had iPhones since the very first one and battery life has always been the biggest issue for me as I use my phone all day for work. But the iPhone X has an incredible battery life. Now I can use the phone all day and at midnight still have around 30-40%. That alone justifies the price these things cost these days!!
125,5,I love everything about it. There is a learning curve but I'm getting used to it. I am terrified to drop it though.
126,3,"So to start with, don’t get me wrong, it’s a beautiful phone. However, for the price point, it was way overpriced. If you have an iPhone 7 or 7+ then truly the upgrade is not worth it I had an issue with my 7+, but I wasn’t real happy with, so this was a forced upgrade. So quite frankly, I don’t think it’s worth enough bread for my iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. I would probably wait a year."
127,3,"I don’t think it’s worth the money. I’ve had it for about a week and it’s still updating my information on it (music, etc). The camera is better than the others but not as great as it’s advertised."
128,5,"This is the best iPhone yet, I love the Face ID. My son had one 1st, once I saw his I had to order mine."
129,5,I bought this iPhone X for myself and it is super great!!!! I upgraded from iPhone 6p and you can really see the difference in speeds. The menus change very quickly and the 4k ultra on the video is fantastic.I like the full screen across the phone as well. You cannot go wrong with this iPhone.
130,5,AT &T delivered the Iphone X less then 48h. I used the app to buy the phone and the experience was amazing. About the phone? It is an Apple of course. I am so impressed with the phone.
131,5,I really like my new iPhone X I couldn’t ask for better.
132,5,"I’ve had iPhones for past 10-11 years and this is by far, the best one! It has beautiful resolution, easy touch screen, incredible pictures, everything is flawless. Siri is much better than ever. I am in love and recommend this phone to all!!"
133,5,But love the size of my phone so that’s a good thing.
134,5,Perfect size phone excellent perfect is all I can say
135,5,"I went from the 7 Plus to the X and it took a little while to get adjusted to the smaller overall size especially the keyboard. However, the device itself is smooth, the response is excellent and it appears to process data, etc pretty quickly. This phone would be perfect if they made it in the Plus size but overall, I like it alot so far."
136,3,"It’s okay. Trying to get used to not having the home button. Face recog is nice, but haven’t noticed much else that’s better than the 6sPlus I had."
137,5,Easy to learn! Love everything about the phone!
138,4,So far it's been an amazing device. I'm personally an Android person but my fiancee is in love with his new phone !
139,2,"I've had iphones since the 4. This is the first time I have ever strongly disliked an iphone. The face recognition is absolutely awful. If you're wearing polarized sunglasses, as I do quite frequently living in California, it won't recognize my face. I have to tap the screen several times for it to ""fail"" so I can get to the passcode screen. Waking up with my face half in a pillow, same thing. I can't just easily touch my phone to unlock it anymore. I was also super excited for the the battery life of a new phone. Nope, this phone doesn't hold battery very well at all. About as well as my 7plus was when it was going down hill. After almost a month of the X, I think its safe to say that there is no way I will be able to deal with this for a whole year. I'm switching to the 8 plus. Face recognition was by far the worst thing apple has come out with yet."
140,5,I like the iPhone X. Not noticing significant difference between iPhone 7 vs X with speed however face rec. feature ruined saving!!
141,4,Very good iPhone so far! At first it was difficult to control but got hang of it within a month.
142,5,Took a while to get use to not using the Home button
143,5,Great phone. The camera takes excellent photos. The best iPhone yet.
144,5,Great screen size but the act phone is still a good size to hold in one hand. Takes a little getting used to the new no button format but no regrets yet.
145,5,I love the improvements apple made on this phone! Weird without the home button but only took 3 days to get used to. Loving my new phone
146,5,Wanted to upgrade from I -phone 6 I am beyond Happy with my New Iphone X
147,5,"Wasn't planned to get a new phone, but so glad I did! Missed the home button at first, but not anymore. Camera on the phone is great and I enjoy the larger screen."
148,5,Phone has a great camera. Love the portrait mode .
149,5,This phone just topped all phone out there with cool new features and thin slick design.
150,4,"Love my new phone - just getting use to it, but do love the size!"
151,5,screen and pictures are amazing. Face Id doesn't work when it is darker. Battery last significantly longer.
152,5,screen and pictures are amazing. Face Id doesn't work when it is darker.
153,4,"Since the 6/6plus, the iPhone really hasn’t had too much progress in the way of updates... until now. The X is the most innovation in the iPhone in 3 generations of models. If you have waited to upgrade, this is the one."
154,5,"My last iPhone was the 6, so I was ready to upgrade and I have to say I LOVE my iPhone X. There were a lot of questions about Face ID, but after using my phone since launch, I can verify that it does work as simply as demonstrated. The feature I love the most however is the battery life. I always felt the Plus iPhones were too large for my pockets and grip, but this one is just right - and b/c of the midway size increase, the battery life with average use lasts me up to 2 days between charges. That means the battery should last twice as long! FYI I replaced my iPhone 6 battery after about 2 years, so this is a great deal. Strongly recommended! Best iPhone yet!!! Plus the Animoji's are hilarious -- if you want a laugh check out #animojikaraoke on twitter ;)"
155,5,This phone is very nice and very fast. Love the face recognition feature. Definitely worth paying the extra money upgrade.
156,5,"At first sight, the well known notch design appears to be highly unattractive. However, once the device is in hand, you begin to notice it less often. The fact that one can hold their smartphone in one hand again without sacrificing screen real estate is fantastic! The new iphone X feels and is premium all around! The new OLED display provides a rich and vibrant viewing experience without emitting overly saturated colors, camera technology is out of this world, speed is completely insane, and the battery life is much better than expected! Sure, the iphone X isn't perfect in every way possible but is indeed a step in a new direction; revolutionary. This is by far the best iphone to date and I'm sure it's only going to keep getting better! -Harmonious"
157,4,"So, this is the first IPhone I have purchased that I didn’t love. I had the 6 Plus before upgrading to this phone and I miss my 6 Plus (I gave it to my son). I heard such amazing things about this phone but the only real amazing thing I like about it is the face recognition. It really works 99% of the time and when it doesn’t, it is usually because I don’t have it up to my face properly. OH, the camera is pretty amazing too. I’ve realized that I miss the home button also. I don’t care for how the software works without the home button. Maybe if the iPhone X were the same size as the 6 Plus I would like it better because I do like the bigger screen on the 6 plus. Maybe that is next."
158,5,My second year of using a IPhone and I love it! The camera is amazing and I love how smaller it is compared to the 7 plus!
159,5,I’m still on the fence about the whole not having a home button and since I wear glasses I had to turn down the sensitivity of the face recognition so I wouldn’t have to take my glasses each time to unlock my phone. But other then that I absolutely love the sleekness of the phone and before I had the iPhone 6s Plus so I have to say it runs faster and I’ve had no issues with it to make me wish I would of bought the 8. After going to Apple I don’t think I could handle going back to any kind of android since my car links up to the iPhone with such ease. Super happy with my purchase.
160,5,"I have no complains about my new phone. Definitely, I can recommend it to buy."
161,3,"I regret switching my plus model for the x, not worth it."
162,5,"This phone is SUPER fast. If you think it the phone will already complete the task. The touch screen is awesome and great display. I do NOT miss the home button at all. Face recognition is SUPER fast and more reliable than finger print. The only issue is that you have to hold the camera just right for it to recognize facial id, however the only time this is an issue if the phone is on a desk or something."
163,4,"Great size, fast and simple to adjust and use. Lacks advanced settings and functions almost to simple for the price."
164,5,"The fact that it did not have a home button made me not want to buy it at first, but all the extra features are so worth it."
165,5,The size and value is a great sweet spot for plus users that were annoyed about carrying such a large phone.
166,5,"I replaced an iphone 6+ with a new iphone X this weekend and the experience was outstanding. Not only did they provide top dollar in bestbuy credit for the replacement phone but we got an excellent deal on a case. The bestbuy representative did everything required to setup and transfer all our apps, media, etc. It takes about an hour but we walked out with a new phone, case and some extra credit on a best buy rewards card. Shopping at Apple or a carrier is not as forgiving as shopping at BestBuy. Thank you and great job."
167,5,Definitely a good phone Apple has done a great job
168,5,"Went in to purchase the 8 Plus, but glad that I decided to get the X. The camera is amazing, love the face ID and other security features!"
169,5,Started getting really warm when using the Arlo app overnight but after the recent updates it was fixed.
170,5,"this case does not add up much bulk to the phone and it protect it all around, i have drop it several time and not a scratch to the phone yet"
171,4,"Even though I was not going to purchase the X, my 6s died. I’m happy now due to the larger storage capacity and larger screen with smaller footprint. Only problem is all my earphones are now unusable with this phone without the adapter."
172,5,best iphone so far... easy to use and only complaint is no bluetooth headphone included
173,5,Best display best camera best processor best software best App Store
174,5,"I am absolutely thrilled with this phone! I was a little hesitant at first - converting from an iPhone 7, but the lack of a home button has been no problem at all! It is super easy to use, the camera is phenomenal, and there are lots of neat little features I continue to discover! I would recommend this phone to anyone considering an upgrade! The larger screen is amazing!"
175,5,This IPhone is great enjoying the easy usage with the facial recognition feature
176,5,"Where do I start? The ten is here and it lives up to its name. The facial recognition feature is a determined leap forward in iPhone security, as surely as the iPhone 5 was with its (then) revolutionary thumb scanner. The elimination of the home button will take some time to adjust to, but adjust you will. The downside of the upswipe to switch from open apps and windows is that to close them becomes a three step process. First the swipe up to view them all, then the depressing of one to prepare some (or all) to close, then finally depressing the red dot close tabs on the corners of the windows. This is at least one step too long, and something I expect the engineers at Apple to rectify in the future. As for the camera, you get what you pay for (in this case, handsomely) from Apple. And, as always, it is nothing short of the current state of the art. The iPhone X has set a new standard in how to deploy pictorial splendor from your pocket. The photos and videos you will record are absolutely breathtaking. This is quite simply the new bar that all other smart phone cameras will be judged by. The portrait mode is in a class by itself. Also included is an updated Clips app that now boasts some augmented reality for your enjoyment. As one would expect, there will come a time when this current incarnation is revealed to be crude and ancient, but for now, it’s quite satisfying. The screen size, is just large enough to take advantage of the superior camera the ten boasts, but still respectful of the constraints of the pockets most of us will be fishing this device in and out from. While the price is extraordinarily steep, it is a worthy successor to Apple’s rich history in setting the standard in smart phones. The X is here. It is a ten."
177,5,"As a nurse, I’m constantly washing my hands... so fingerprint access wouldn’t work. Now I can log on in the dark at night, pruny wet fingers. Love the 256 gb, the full screen!"
178,5,Very impressed thought I would miss the home button but not at all!!!! By far the best phone I have ever had. Was scared because of bad reviews but they were all wrong! Great phone
179,5,"Had the iPhone 7 plus, which was great!! However the size of the 10 is much better for me. Screen is amazing and the overall performance is amazing. Very happy with this phone."
180,5,Works great I would recommend to some one else. Good help at dtore
181,5,I love how easy this phone is to use and gave recognition is awesome
182,5,Love the iPhone X. I’ve had the 6 for a long time I was ready for a change. The only trouble I noticed was when I try to open an app it take a few tries like as if my it’s not feeling my finger there. Other then that so far I like it.
183,5,No issues or complaints. woks well as with most i phones
184,5,My initial hesitation to wait was too cautious. This is a great phone. Facial recognition is fantastic.
185,5,"Got this for my wife, she loves it. The animojis are fun, and overall great fast phone."
186,3,I’ve had an iPhone since the 3G and even though this is the newest and greatest it’s not all that. I got it for my wife to replace her iPhone 6 and we almost returned it. Screen is nice and it’s fast but there is a lot she doesn’t like about it. I don’t even like to use it. We almost returned it for the 8plus but wound up keeping it. I’d wait for the next one with some modifications.
187,5,"Haven’t had phone long, but it works great so far. The camera is very nice."
188,5,Moved up from a 6S and find the X to be easy to hold and use.
189,5,The iPhone X is the most powerful beautiful phone they have ever created. Not having a home button is not even an issue since you get so use to how fast using the home bar is.
190,1,"I wanted an unblocked, without carrier... when got back to Brazil, found out that it is blocked. Don't recommend it to any foreigners."
191,5,I have had this phone for two months. I have not had any issues.
192,5,Had it for two months and have not had any issues.
193,5,I have to leave my phone in my vehicle when I'm at work and the cold used to kill the battery on my IPhone 6. The cold doesn't kill the battery on the IPhone X
194,5,"I like very much to buy at Best Buy, great products portfolio and good services offered, Laudalio."
195,5,Can’t say enough about how great the iPhone X is. I was skeptical about Face ID at first (which I feel most people are) but it works far better than I expected. I actually like it better than Touch ID. Awesome job apple!
196,1,It slowed down on day 3! The battery life is poor and getting worse. Phone hates the cold!
197,5,This was a great deal and Present for my wife...She loves it!
198,5,The size with a big screen did it for me. After using my 7plus for a year this one got me because of the size the speed was not bad too.
199,5,A great device it it has a lot of nee features that make this a great device
200,5,"I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it! As far as performance, I don't know. I don't use it."
201,5,There is nothing like this of course. No home button was interestiat first but I get used to it real fast. Face ID is fun too
202,5,"The I-phone X is amazing! Love all of the features as well as the camera. Since I was don’t paying off my previous phone (I-phone 6) I figured I would get the 8. But after I saw the X and what it could do, I just knew I had to have it. Glad I made the purchase."
203,5,"This is by far the best phone I have ever purchased. I was hesitant at first due to the removal of the home button but I was wrong. It took all of one afternoon and I was navigating ios faster than ever. Battery Life rocks and FaceID is spot on. You will not regret purchasing the iPhone 10. Dennis Garrison and Paige Cecil delivered unparalleled customer service. If you want a great shopping experience go to the Greenwood Mall in Bowling Green, KY!"
204,5,"Great reaction on calls, photos files ,I like announcing calls."
205,3,The phone is ok. I guess I don’t use all the features so I’m not seeing what all the hype is about
206,5,I used sales normally but this phones Camer is so good I’m ok leaving my camera at home for quick snapshots.
207,5,I have been really pleased with the improved camera! I am surprised by how much I like the removal of the home button. Best iPhone to date.
208,5,"Love the Face ID. It works with sunglasses, in the dark. But the greatest feature is with opening apps with the Face ID security. The speakers are great to and it all works flawlessly with my Apple Watch and AirPods."
209,5,I-Phone X is the phone to have. Facial recognition works perfectly. Never had a problem with this phone.
210,5,"A Xmas gift for my girlfriend. She seems to love it, especially the camera quality."
211,5,Works as advertised. Wouldn’t trade it for all the Samsung’s in he world
212,5,"I have had an iPhone since they first came out, the iPhone X is easy to maneuver around and very similar to the rest of the iPhones just with upgrades and better camera options."
213,5,I really like my new iPhone X. It is so much faster than my iPhone 6.
214,5,The camera is one of the best. The battery life is amazing and I like the smaller footprint compared to the plus variants.
215,5,Dont get stuck to buying from service providers use interest free financing via best buy no hassle and can use any carrier
216,5,Takes a little bit to get used to but a very welcomed change. This is second one I have bought. One for my son. He loves it too. No complaints at all
217,3,The camera is nice but the editing features are the same as the iPhone 6. The rest of the phone is pretty much the same as the iPhone 6 and the super display it’s supposed to have I haven’t really noticed a difference. Don’t upgrade if the phone you still have works. Mine died otherwise I probably wouldn’t have bought this phone. Kinda wish I had just had a new camera (that’s what broke) put into my old phone.
218,4,"Great new features, fantastic cameras. But as an iPhone user for years, no home button is crazy! But getting used to it...,"
219,5,I love the full screen on the iPhone X! It’s thin and not bulky. Highly impressed with Apple!
220,4,"Great phone but miss the finger print option to unlock the phone. If you’re laying down and your face is covered by your pillow, your phone won’t unlock"
221,5,I had never owned an iPhone before. It was time to upgrade so I went for the iPhone X. Figured I’d go for the best. It doesn’t disappoint. It is quite easy to use even without the home button. The facial recognition works great for me even in low light.
222,4,"I like the design and battery life, but still has some bugs that apple should fix in the next software updates."
223,5,Excellent Phone. Best Buy sell the phone that is not activated if you pay full price. The phone will be locked with the SIM card that you insert first - except if you use Verizon.
224,4,"I like the iPhone X. It’s fast, the colors on the screen are really vibrant. My only complaint is that the Face ID doesn’t always work. Also there is no dedicated power off button. Other than those things, the phone is great! I thought I would miss having a home button, but I got over it."
225,5,First iPhone in a while where I felt I actually got a new phone. Love it
226,5,Brought for myself to pass the old one off to my daughter!!!
227,5,It’s the greatest iPhone yet!! It’s so much nicer then my iPhone 7 Plus to have the larger screen but smaller phone again.
228,5,"It’s amazing phone, its finally caught up to Samsung!"
229,4,This is a great hone for someone who loves extra features and the the latest technology.. Facial recognition for s fun and the live screensavers are neat.
230,5,Apple makes the best phones out there. Phone looks and operates flawlessly.
231,5,"I purchased this for a gift for Christmas, and they loved it!"
232,5,Happy with my upgrade. Was looking for a new phone for awhile and the Iphonex was what I needed.
233,4,"I don't know why the number 9 was skipped, but this phone has a great size. Very sleek and fast. I've had issues with faceID to unlock the phone, sometimes the clock and widgets would disappear and you see nothing but your wallpaper. I don't know if it's the phone or the iOS itself. It operates really fast, though. I'll admit that I kinda miss the home button and powering off with just one button. Yes, that's right. You have to power it off with 2 buttons."
234,5,"Had 2 Samsung Note 3’s for the last 4 years, never had a problem with either one but decided it was time to upgrade. Chose 2 iPhone X’s 256GB. All we can say is WOW! Bye bye Samsung, hello iPhone. Like having a pocket size IPad Pro"
235,5,Great product. Much light and easier to use than previous models. Best iPhone upgrade by Apple so far
236,5,It is by far their best phone. I was concerned about face recognition but I actually love it. The new features take some getting used to but worth it. Oh and the cameras are amazing.
237,5,Phone is great. Take a minute to get used to no home button. Like the phone a lot.
238,5,Great addition to the Apple lineup. The smoothest UI I’ve ever used on a smartphone. Just hope they design an XL next year.
239,4,Upgrading from iPhone 4 to an X made the wait worth it but the cost is outrageous and the facial recognition doesn't always work in poor lighting or if you delay bring it up to face.
240,5,Love my new phone. New features take a bit to get used to but all in all Apple did a nice job on this new phone. Best Buy was awesome to work with in getting my full profile brought over from my old phone to the new one. Would definitely recommend purchasing your new phone from Best Buy.
241,5,So far so good! i'm sure it does so much more then i have begun to touch on but for the basics..talk...photo...fast searching and apps....i love it!
242,5,Face ID does not disappoint. It works every time. It is fast enough that you don't even know it happened. The bigger screen with the smaller form-factor makes this phone a winner!
243,5,"I really like this iPhone. The notch at the top does not bother me at all. Battery life is really good as I am on my phone constantly. The screen size is just perfect, and I like that the bezels are virtually non-existing. Great phone."
244,5,"I like that technology improves everyday more, the camera and thinsg you can do with phone are amazing"
245,5,"Easy to use, fast. Best iPhone and I’ve had them all."
246,4,"I think it's the best iPhone yet, but I give it 4 stars because it's so pricey."
247,5,Bought this for our son and he loved it. Camera is outstanding!
248,5,Definitely a worthwhile upgrade from the iPhone 7.
249,5,"I upgraded from a 5c and am so glad I did! The facial recognition alone makes this phone awesome. It works not only to unlock the phone, but it works on apps such as my bank as well. The size, the screen clarity, the camera, the speed...I have zero complaints...well, except it would be nice if it cost a little less. It takes a little longer to fully charge the battery, so I do recommend the Mophe Wireless Charger."
250,5,MOVED FROM THE NOTE HARD TO ADAPT BUT A GOOD PHONE OVERALL
251,5,So far it works like advertised and I have not had any problems. The battery seems to last much better than my 6s
252,5,"I was torn between the iPhone 8 Plus and the X. I had been really happy with my 6 Plus, but decided to upgrade so I could give my phone to my daughter as a starter phone being she was familiar with it. I am so happy I chose the X. The camera is amazing and I love that it fits in my hand. Plus, it is so fast when opening apps and emails."
253,5,This phone has been amazing. You quickly get used to not having a home button and don't miss it. The Face ID recognition is awesome. It works perfectly and I love how I just look at my phone and it automatically signs me into websites I visit often.
254,5,A good phone. Not sure if it's better than my old one but I'm giving it a shot. :)
255,5,"Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, I wasn't expecting to be blown away. Turns out, I was still wowed by this phone."
256,5,I am very please with overhaul purchase in store at Huntington Mall. I always am a satisfied customer. Thank you Best Buy
257,5,"My wife loves her new phone, she yet to find anything wrong with it."
258,3,"Expected more features for the price. Too expensive, camera is great, Face ID ok, expected larger screen"
259,5,Definitely love the iPhone X love how it’s all screen and no home button
260,4,I bought this as a gift. It is the newest iPhone with the latest features. So far she is happy with it.
261,5,Best iPhone yet. Once you get used to the swipe gestures this phone is simply the fastest phone I have ever used. Love that they didn't feel the need to put out another ginormous phone on the market. Was a relief to go back to a relatively small phone. The facial recognition has been flawless for me. I do notice some apps randomly lock up. More the developers fault I think. Love the phone.
262,4,Awesome phone and camera Face ID water resistant wireless charging
263,5,the camera is as good as advertised and the screen clarity is awesome. she loves the facial recognition feature to open the phone.
264,5,The updated iPhone has been everything I expected and more. The Face ID works perfectly and the camera is outstanding.
265,5,"I was hesitant at first cause I love(d) the home button.. but this iPhone X with the facial recognition is sweet. Bigger screen, yet still small enough to use one handed. Way to go Apple."
266,5,the staff at best buy was very helpful every step of the way
267,5,"Great pictures, great microphone, easy to use, Apple out did itself! Love it"
268,5,Best iPhone ever. I had an iPhone 4s years ago then all Samsung phones. Love this iPhone.
269,4,"So I said I would never pay a thousand dollars for a phone......Well, never say never. I read all there was to read about the iphone X and I knew going in it was very expensive. I had a 6 Plus and it was painfully slow (everyone now knows why) and I was just tired of messing with it. I was in Best Buy (where I get all my phones) and I decided to make the leap. Here are my initial thoughts. Picture is supurb. The phone feels a lot smaller than my 6 Plus even though I know the screen is about the same size, it just feels smaller. Which, I guess is a good thing but I liked the size of my 6 Plus. But I put this phone in a bigger case to make up for that feel I missed with the plus size phone. I know, I'm an ""older"" user so having the convenience of slipping this phone in my pocket is not something I need like most on-the-go younger folks do, I just want to be able to see things on the screen and not feel like I don't have a handle on the phone. So I guess for me, size does matter. The face recognition has worked basically flawlessly for me so far. Its a pretty cool concept that probably needs some tweeking because I do find myself having to do more to get into the phone than I did before. You have to raise the phone to your face so it can identify you then you have to swipe up from the bottom of the phone to get into it. I think if they had a setting that would allow you to open the phone by face ID and not have to swipe to get in, I'd like that a lot better. Having said that, I've never been one of those people that uses a security code to get into my phone and I always worried about losing my phone and someone being able to get right into it. I just hated having to punch in a code each time I wanted to use it. I gave the phone to my wife for her to look at and delighted in the fact that she was totally frustrated that she could not get into it. She kept pointing the phone at me to unlock it and I would look away and it would not unlock. I have to admit, I do like that security feature and not having to punch in a code to get into it is pretty cool to me. I know several others have complained about the fact that now you have to swipe down from the top to get the control center and you have to do a swiping gesture to open up the multiple window function. I guess for me, its no big deal to have to swipe now rather than hit a button. If you grew up using virtually every variation of iphones going back to 2007, you are used to the button. But this one does not have a button and everyone that buys it should know that so why on earth would not having a button be an issue? I don't know, its just different and a lot of people don't like change. Me, I have no problem. I have heard that Apple might be bringing a virtual button back in the next update but all the functionality of the phone works fine for me. Its blazing fast, and that is what I am most happy about. The camera, both video and pictures, works very well. I am a bit of a semi-professional photographer and I will never stop using my DSLR cameras but this phone takes pretty amazing pictures, I have to admit. In fact, I also do some video editing on my Mac and the video images rivaled my 4k Canon 6D. I was really impressed with the video. One more aspect that is greatly improved is the audio of this phone. And I don't necessarily mean quality audio, even though I do think its better, I mean the volume. I use my phone when I get ready in the morning to listen to the watch ESPN app and at times on my 6 plus, the audio was not loud enough to hear when I was running water or something like that. On this phone, I have zero issues hearing it. I'm very impressed with that aspect alone. Its amazing how much sound comes out of this phone. In conclusion, for me, someone who lives in a Mac ecosphere, (Mac computer, iPad's, Apple watch, multiple iPhones and Mac book pro), this device is very familiar. If you've used iPhones for a while in the past, you will have no trouble adapting to the changes that to me, are intuitive because there is no home button. I had no trouble figuring..."
270,5,"I see it... It’s sees me.... I recognize it... it recognizes me... Actually great device; great use of real estate... if you need a Plus, buy the Mini"
271,5,"An easy to use (once you get some exposure to the i-crowd). I wish it came with some instructions, but Google gets it done. A bit pricey."
272,5,Best Christmas gift to myself! My sales representative is always great!
273,4,Apple's most expensive phone... but I think they did a good job!
274,4,It's quite a bit different from my last iPhone (6S). Complicated to get used to but good nonetheless.
275,5,"Expensive. But I don’t drink, smoke, gamble or chew...so I thought I could spend some on a shiny toy. Been really fun so far. Battery is not as long Life as iPhone 6s... :(("
276,5,I'm happy with my purchase.Best buy has an excellent customer service
277,5,Facial recognition is far superior than anything out there. Even in pitch dark
278,5,The camera is amazing. It exceeded my expectations and more.
279,5,"This phone is amazing! It’s like an iPhone on steroids! Don’t believe those YouTube reviews on how it’s not worth the money! They are just Trying to sell you another phone to make a buck! First, facial recognition is faster than it ever needs to be! Second,The camera sticks out but if you put a phone case on it! It levels it out nicely! Third. Apple has the most reliable electronics in there iPhone! Period! And that’s why I would never look at another brand. So for me, it’s worth the extra money just for that piece of mind."
280,5,Camera is great upgrade and loss of home button is an easy transition
281,5,I love the talking emoji. The photo movies. The live pictures. Easy to use highly recommend
282,1,"I bought an iphone X and nobody told me they were giving an iphone 8 for free. I found out later and when I called about it, they told me it was too late."
283,5,I love this phone and it was definitely worth the wait!
284,5,"I bought this phone about three weeks ago and it’s amazing. I had the iPhone 7 Plus and didn’t really feel like I needed an upgrade but went ahead and did it. It’s perfect. I’ve had the 4,5,6, and 7 plus and I can say that this phone is by far the best and easiest to use. I almost went with the note 8 but the size of the iPhone X is perfect for me. I love the design for this phone but I bought a case and it kind of take the hype out of it but I would rather have protection. I’d say if you have the money and want a great phone GET IT! I know it’s pricey. It’s great with my Apple Watch too."
285,4,I buy two iphone and one does not turn on and the other one when I'm using some app it shuts down
286,5,The OLED screen is a game changer and the battery life is heads and shoulders better than an iPhone 7.
287,5,It takes some getting used to but the phone is pretty good. But I would have been just as happy with the 8.
288,5,The technology is just simply awesome! First of its kind.
289,5,"I love the IphoneX!! At first, I didn't see the differences. When I started to explore and get used to the phone, I realized how much better the display, graphics, camera, speed, and features are! I'm so happy with my new phone!! I love it!!"
290,5,Great features! Easy to use and great for pictures!
291,3,I didn’t like the phone. I was use to a larger phone. I didn’t like where the Siri button Was.
292,4,"For the most part I like my new iPhone X, the only thing I don't care for is how difficult it is to shut down."
293,2,Still freezes. Needs more work. Screen don’t react as fast and colors fade
294,5,"For my daughter for Christmas, she loves it. She especially loves the quality and high level of technology that the camera has. She also uses it with her virtual reality set. It is awesome."
295,4,"First: the buying process was painful - waited for nearly an hour for anyone to sell me the product. Then, all they tried to do was upsell, trying to talk me into things I didn't want - terrible. As for the iPhone X, I like that the screen covers nearly the entire front of the phone. The cameras are great, and there are some other nice features. On the downside, I would prefer a little smaller overall size - more like the iPhone 7 or 8. Also, the phone gets hot when making a call or other use for more than just a couple minutes. Definitely overpriced but, I still bought 2 just because I wanted the latest model."
296,1,I was talked out of the iPhone 8 Plus for the I phone X don’t do it. The face view barely works and the missing home button is frustrating. The phone freezes never had these issues with the other I phones.
297,4,"I love the speed of the processor, The size of the screen and the large hard drive capacity.I also like that the unit is water resistant.There is a little bit of a learning curve but it is intuitive.I like the face recognition but in low light, it sometimes struggles and the password needs to be punched in by hand.Overall I am loving the phone"
298,5,"Nice upgrade from an iPhone 7. Kinda miss the Touch ID though. I do like the new features, and I’m sure I will get used to the new gestures. Overall, it’s a great phone. Can’t wait to see what Apple continues to do from here on out."
299,5,"Super nice cellphone, work fast very comfortable to use."
300,1,"My boyfriend and I both switched to Verizon and got the iPhone X on Black Friday. We are extremely unsatisfied with the purchase, these phones are a complete waste of money. The screens go blank, apps will constantly crash, the phone will randomly shut off, you name it. We were so excited to get it and wanted to love the phone so badly but both deeply regret our purchase. For the price I would expect this phone to be better than the iPhone 6 but this is one of the worst phones I've ever had."
301,4,"Very nice phone, not quite worth all the fuss....or the price Face ID is nice but not much better than fingerprint I’d."
302,5,Love the seamlessness of the facial recognition. From opening the phone to paying bills is super easy and fast.
303,5,"Surfing the internet is really truly fast almost like using mynhome pc. The text to speech is very accurate. I travel theu the US and the screen does not freeze like people wore claiming. Which was why I waited to upgrade and i travel to places that are -25 degrees. The facial recognition makes it easier to open my phone and you can incorporate it into most apps for ease of use. The camera takes awesome pics and its an all around pretty phone. Big screen enough to watch movies but also compact enough to text with one hand. I Love this phone and it takes care of my personal, financial and work needs. Plus large capacity storage for the size."
304,5,I had a Samsung Edge 7.Ive been a Samsung fans for as long as I can remember.Switched over to Apple and I don’t regret it nothing against android and I still love Samsung but I totally love my IPhone X by far.
305,5,I went from a 6 plus to the X. I love it.
306,5,"This is a beautiful phone. It’s not really an issue that there is no home button or headphone jack, as swiping up from the bottom works perfectly to take you home, and Apple includes earbuds that plug into the lightning charger port in case you don’t have wireless headphones. The glass back, front screen with curved sides, and bigger picture all make this a beautiful object, though because it is so incredibly expensive, you will probably want to put it in a case and put on a screen protector, which will compromise its beauty. The camera also takes gorgeous photos."
307,1,"I upgraded from the iphone 6s after mine slowed down considerably with the iOS 11 update. What a mistake. Would rather have the slow 6s instead of this expensive and glitchy nightmare. What's terrible about it? 1) It is much heavier than 6s- you will feel it dragging down your pocket. 2) The camera is slow and freezes all the time. When it does take a picture, the colors are way off. Major step backward in general usability of the camera compared to 6s. 3) Lots of little glitches: text messages that get garbled for no consistent reason, auto correct that seems much dumber than the old one, Siri doesn't work while using WAZE, etc... 4) It is too big to operate with one hand. The 6s was the perfect size, this thing is just slightly bigger but it is enough of a difference that operation with one hand is very awkward. You would think Apple would re-arrange buttons to make it easier to reach them with the larger screen. But no, that button you seem to always need to hit is a very very long stretch with your thumb while you pray that you don't drop your phone. I hate this phone. 3 friends have it as well, and only one of them likes it. The other two are sorry they bought it. Save your money and go iphone 8 or Android."
308,5,Upgraded from the iPhone 7 even though I did not need to but did it anyway: battery is as good as my 7 and it is just an awesome phone. I am very pleased with my purchase even though the price could of been lower but overall- Nice phone
309,4,"my wife has always been a fan of iphone, she likes all the new upgrades from her iphone 6s. so there is a lot of improvements for her. face recognition is cool, im not a smartphone camera person, i like true cameras, but for her she likes some of the new features for the on board camera."
310,4,I love this phone it is very different from the other phones and it took me a minute to get used to.
311,5,"Great phone. Smooth, fast and battery lasts all day."
312,5,The facial recognition Works great I have not had any problems with my iPhone X yet. I enjoy it thoroughly
313,5,Great phone. Very fast and reliable. No complaints so far.
314,1,Way to much more work to operate than older iPhones. Huge disappointment! Don’t waste your money/upgrade!
315,4,Only had it about a week but it seems to be great. Very easy to pick up all of the new features. Seems like I’m still learning more every day.
316,3,"The phone itself is amazing the problem is the battery. I have to have the brightness almost all the way down and can’t really mess with it very much in order for it to last the whole day. It’s a powerhouse phone though, just be prepared to be chained to a wall outlet."
317,5,I am an 84 year old and I just love this IPhone X. Best of all is the face recognition and being able to use Apple Pay.
318,5,Love the phone it has great battery life !! Nice and sleek fit!! Face ID is super amazing quick and easy to access the phone. The switching around of the features definitely gives it a level up its still the same iPhone just with a twist it made it fun to relearn the functions of the X. It made the experience new completely. I am taking it for what it is and enjoying it Apple is truly THE BEST
319,5,I wish the phone came as a plus but I like it. Apple has out done themselves once again! Great features & the face ID is pretty cool. And the camera is freaking awesome!!
320,4,"Loving my new iPhone X! fast, smooth, easy to use! Nice upgrade from iPhone 5s, so many new and wonderful features."
321,5,"I have to say I myself am very impressed with the iPhone. For those coming from anything “plus” yes it will initially feel smaller. But you will quickly find that you fall in love with the speed and easy use of the phone so that you stop noticing the size difference. The screen is the most crisp it has ever been, with a beautiful display. If all else falls just open the camera... apple has truly outdone itself with the best camera to ever hit a apple device."
322,5,"So far so good! Absolutely love the phone, great picture quality and speed, along with a phenomenal camera."
323,5,The screen is awesome. Love that it’s the same size screen as the 8s Plus but the phone itself is the size of the 8s. the pictures are super clear and crisp. And i like the new features of no home button and the talking emojis. Lol. So much fun. I hate the hefty price tag but i do love the phone.
324,5,It’s everything the other kids want plus some
325,5,This is by far the best iPhone apple has ever came up with! It has everything an iPhone does and has those features of the Samsung we always wanted all wrapped up in th X!!!
326,5,Excellent phone! Love the new full screen!
327,5,"It’s great, screen is increadbly sharp easy to see and phone easy to hold with one hand!"
328,4,I love my new phone! Other than my Face ID doesn’t really work in cold weather.
329,5,"The battery life is good , easy to manage, good camera and lots of new features that I still need to learn."
330,5,I really enjoy the new look of the iPhone X. I really enjoy having the facial recognition. I am glad that I went with the iPhone X. I highly recommended this phone for both the young and young at heart. It offers something for everyone. I definitely don’t want to forget about the battery life on this phone-its great.
331,5,"First off I'll say I'm not one sided just for apple. There are android products that are equal to the iphone. I've tried both at different times and depending on what you use your phone for one can be better than the other. If you just use the a phone for surfing web, texting, watching videos and possibly a phone call (nah, who does that) then just about any smart phone will do. I do prefer the overall echo system apple provides and prefer the iphone because of it. Now that being said, I did have my doubts about face recognition but it seems to work well. I have had it not work on occasion and i just punched in my security code to unlock the phone. It does work most of the time and its pretty quick. The times it has not worked was when I caused a large distortion of my face compared to what my face looked like when i scanned it originally. An example of this was the phone started to scan my face and at about the same time I had to yawn, my yawning face didn't let the phone unlock via the facial recognition. Overall the phone is an awesome upgrade from my 3yr old 6 plus. The front and back cameras both take awesome pictures. I would recommend this phone. The down side, the price is crazy expensive. I purchase my phone out right which really hurts the wallet, its also why my last phone was 3yrs old. I don't upgrade every year."
332,5,"SO easy to use, love teh new features. Very happy with the upgrade"
333,4,Great screen. The camera and supporting hardware is far and away the best feature of the phone. Very fast hardware overall.
334,5,"Having owned several smart phones starting with android. I made the move over to the apple ecosystem several years ago starting with the iPhone 5s and have had a few hand sets 6s and se. I love how everything about iPhone just works. There was no looking for alternative apps or tweaking a setting to get things to function. With this phone I already knew it was great looking, but what I’m amazed at is how great and intuitive it really is. The loss of the home button you would think would limit functionality or find yourself missing the center piece of apples iOS hardware ui. This is not the case I find on my other idevices I try to use the touch only interface of the iPhone X. Tap to wake, swipe up to go home, or swipe on the charm bar to seamlessly switch between apps it’s great. Battery life is stellar especially with the stock all black apple wallpaper, thanks to the new oled display. FaceID works quickly and accurately, and I love that notifications on the lock screen are in private mode until I look at them. Just a great user experience and why I rely on the apple eco system of devices. Display ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Camera⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Speed⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
335,5,"Same old iPhone like usual, nothing really new but a much higher price. I do love the screen and how it’s fully fulfilled. I love the camera and the Face ID works flawlessly. It’s very responsive and it’s definitely worth the extra money for it."
336,5,I absolutely love it! The display is crystal clear and the camera takes fantastic pictures.
337,5,Inreally like this phone. Its not too big and not too small.
338,3,"Have had iPhones since they first came out , from the 3 to the 4s and then the 6 plus , upgraded to the X , oh boy ! Take a lot of getting use to , switching apps and closing apps , everything is different, no home button, not sure if I want to change to the 8 arg"
339,5,OLED 4K screen is awesome and facial recognition is pretty cool too
340,5,"I was skeptical about this product when it was announced several months ago. There was so much emphasis placed on the brilliant camera that it was that I really didn't care. I. am old school. I like my phone first and foremost to be a good phone. Turns out this is the best phone that I have ever had, and I have had all the iPhones plus several prior to iPhones coming to the market. The face recognition device is intuitive and gets smarter with use. I thought I would miss the home button to which I now way ""what home button?!' If you can afford it, get one."
341,5,I really love my new iPhone X. I have used An iPhone since the first one came out 10 years ago. It felt like a natural progression swiping up on the screen. I don’t miss the home button at all. It’s quick and flawless.
342,5,I am way happier with the new iPhone! I had a iPhone 6S plus and as much as I loved the big screen it was just junk from start to finish but the new X runs and performs way better with no issues!
343,5,The iPhone X is an excellent upgrade from the my previous version of the 7. The camera take amazing photos. The feature are great. I do recommend.
344,5,Great improvement over the previous iPhone...worth the money
345,5,The camera is outstanding! The speed of the devise is unbelievable. I am so pleased.
346,5,its a good phone jsut dont know if is worth that much money but when your wife ask for it what can you do lol
347,5,Enjoying my Iphone X and the new features. I love the quality of the product. Best phone I have owned.
348,5,"Beautiful, easy to use, faster, many things of new staff"
349,5,"Is like having a personal computer fully loaded on your pocket, love this phone"
350,5,Love the face ID and how fast the phone responds. The screen is just as big as the plus and the phone is easier to hold. The camera is phenomenal.....so happy that I upgraded
351,5,"IPhoneX is absolutely incredible, ANY bad reviews must be from people who either don’t know what they are doing or have buyers remorse because it’s costly, but it’s worth it."
352,2,"I've had this phone for a few weeks now. Although they say the screen is larger, it doesn't appear larger, just taller. Watching videos especially on youtube is horrible as the aspect ratio is really odd on this iPhone. It doesn't use the full screen unless you zoom in. At that point, things get cropped out of the video. Don't get me wrong, this is a great phone. For the price, I would expect it to be a lot more exciting and less gimmicky."
353,3,Screen saver for some reason unlocks horizontal when I closed phone vertical...hmm Wish I could swap out this phone for another.
354,5,Face ID works great and the screen looks amazing..
355,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus to the iPhone X and love this phone. It was an easy transition from the 6 to the X and you will get use to the new features quickly. I was torn between the 8 and the X but I'm happy I decided to go with the X
356,5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
357,3,I have been using iPhone since 7years. But this time I am Facing lot of issues in screen rotations & Face ID is bit slow. Not up to the expectations.
358,5,I love this phone. The size is the perfect balance for someone who loves the bigger look but enjoys the slightly smaller size. The interface is surprising easy to learn adjust to. The camera is an amazing upgrade! I love using all the different features to enhance the photos of my family.
359,4,At first the iPhone X was very confusing but once you get to use it you will get used to it just like anything else very quickly
360,5,"It’s the best iPhone yet, the Oled screen is amazing as is the cameras"
361,3,Face detection vs finger print reader isn’t even close. It feels like the product was rushed to bring to market without a home button. Lots of things are good about the phone but LOTS of bad. Screen is great however the gestures could be a lot better. The phone feels like it questions what you want it to do. Flipping between apps takes more time. Unlocking your phone when you’re not looking right at it isn’t great.
362,5,"Easy to use, particularly for someone already familiar with the iPhone."
363,5,Love the features and speed of this device. Great job Apple
364,5,"Highly recommend the “X” ... it takes some getting use to without the home button, but the learning curve if you’re an avid iPhone user is fairly quick. Processor is super fast. Camera’s photo quality, as expected, is somewhat disappointing."
365,1,"The phone is average. Photo clarity is wonderful, however my phone keeps freezing at the home screen which throws me for a loop. Overall it’s average to other iPhones."
366,5,What can one say about a beautiful phone? I am a die hard iPhone fan and I have been in the AT&T “next” program for a couple years now and when this phone came along I of course jumped at it! I love the new screen real estate and it’s smaller size overall..( my previous phone was the iPhone 7plus) which was a bit too big! This phone is also faster and has loads of useful features! The only complaint I have is that a few of the hidden features are not explained....for example...if you have the phone in your hand and it rings ...the volume drops really low...almost to the point of being a “whisper”...I thought the phone was defective so I made the AT&T person prepare a new phone for me only to find out that the new phone did the same thing! (If the phone rings while it is NOT in your hand the volume is as loud as you set it! The idea I guess is that you don’t need it blasting in your ear if you already know it’s ringing! Ibfelt that the sales person should have known this instead of making me spend another hour activating a different phone!
367,5,"After having all of the iphones, Apple did it Right with this one. The Iphone X is wonderful.....great display, easy to use and a great sleek look. There is a little bit of a learning curve, learning the way of using the phone but its very simple, once you get the hang of it. Totally recommend this iPhone!!"
368,5,"Love the upgrade, but not the price tag. That's what you get for having the coolest phone available."
369,5,I did the upgrade as a Christmas & Birthday gift to myself. Still learning all of the ins and outs but so loving the new unlock system .... FACE RECOGNITION.... XOXO
370,5,Will be even greater as soon as I figure out how to use all the wonderful things it does. Lol Still working on that
371,5,Love the new full OLED screen. Colors are so vibrant!
372,5,"Phone is awesome, service is better!!"
373,2,"I don't really like the IPhone X. If I wanted an Android, I would have bought one. I wish I would have kept my 7+. It is not user friend, I hate freaking swiping. Bring back the fingerprint recognition. Most offices do not allow cameras."
374,5,Everything so far is great
375,5,"Love the slickness, the photo recognition,"
376,3,"I have been an Iphone user for 5 years or so. The X is my third Iphone. I love the size of it and my 4 year old LOVES the animated emoji thing. The camera is really good, but doesn't feel much different than the camera on the 8. What is very different is not having a home button. One of the biggest reasons I miss it is that you HAVE to pick up your phone to access the home page. You can't just put your finger on the home button to be recognized. You have to pick it up so your facial recognition will work. One other thing that I don't think any of the engineers thought about - SWIPING UP FOR EVERYTHING CAN CAUSE FOREARM FATIGUE! Think about it, pressing a button with your thumb is a lot easier than moving your hole thumb 1 to 2 inches up 1000 times throughout the day. I have had the phone for 2 weeks or so, but I have noticed that on days I've used the phone a lot that my right forearm is tired. All in all it's a cool phone. But I wish they had left the home button alone."
377,5,"pics are much better, learning how to use it still, Face ID is the great it works in the dark, I was impressed"
378,4,My iPhone X is just ok. My battery life is poor. My battery dies fast. I can’t listen to What’s App voice note messages while I’m on a call. My phone seems slower and I’m not sure about this phone. The pictures are ok nothing to brag about
379,5,"I went to this from a 6 and no matter what, transfer from one phone to another is never seamless. The biggest thing is no more finger prints! So everything you get into with a fingerprint, you need to remember the password to. I locked myself out of 3 of my accounts. That was a pain, and not every app does facial recognition so be prepared to change passwords, which isn’t a bad thing really. Getting used to swiping everything is easy once you know how and which way to swipe. No home button. But it is easy to forget once you get used to swiping. Battery lasts all day. Big plus. Fast. Bigger plus. I am enjoying getting to know the X."
380,5,Got item for my kids for Christmas. They absolutely love phone.
382,5,So far il lovei it. It was a little hard to get use to no home button but once you do its really easy. I dont usethe face recognition bc id like passcodes.
383,5,"The Apple iPhone X is an Amazing device, so many features, so much capability. I was skeptical about using facial recognition at first but now I’m sold. The only negative thing I can say is, there aren’t many AR apps out there, but that’ll change"
384,5,Great phone it works great
385,5,Works well with Otter Box so far. Would like to see privacy screens for sale
386,5,"What can I say? State-of-the-art device that leaves the competition in the dust! It’s everything you expect in an iPhone and more. Facial ID is the bomb while screen size is (in my opinion) optimal though smaller than the iPhone 8. I say optimal because at some point in the evolution of smart phones as the screens get progressively larger the device ceases to be a phone and becomes a tablet or mini-laptop. If you want a phone buy an iPhone X. If you want a tablet (or larger) then buy that type device and “enjoy” lugging that around. As for me, the iPhone X is easy to see with unmatched clarity, and is easy to carry on your belt or in your pocket (or anywhere else you desire) without toting some sort of “brick” around with you."
387,5,All my life I had been an android user but once I made up my mind to get the iPhone I couldn’t be happier. The only problem I have is the music.
388,5,"Was a little insitated to change my iPhone 7 Plus for the X. The best decision ever. At first was confused always looking for the home button. But after a day, I dont even miss it. So flawless and smooth, everybody complements the phone and pictures taken with this phone. Also don’t need to recharge the phone during the day, the battery last the entire day even using social media and texting a lot. Love it."
389,5,Takes some getting used to but pretty neat. Love the face Recognition.
390,5,The iPhone X is a great phone. The camera is so much better than my iPhone 7 was. The Facial unlock feature is so easy to use. Call quality is wonderful. I highly recommend getting this phone.
391,5,Love this phone. I like that it’s small enough for one hand but has the camera of the plus.
392,5,The phone is amazing. The only thing I don’t like is the way you completely close apps. I like the swipe up method better than the hold down and X out of it. Just takes longer and is more difficult. The batter life is phenomenal and the facial recognition is awesome. Just an overall amazing phone.
393,5,Upgrade from 6+. Like the new OS with the new device. Easy transfer of data. Went to productivity immediately. Not missing the home button at all! Multitasking smooth. Figured out how to close apps very intuitively.
394,3,I should have kept my Iphone7
395,5,This is my 4th iPhone. Definitely each one has made great improvements. Love everything about the phone including the shiny silver. I think it’s a classy phone. Great photos!!
396,3,"It feels the same as every other iPhone I received. iPhone 6s is a great phone and I regret paying this much money for an iPhone, I will never do it again."
397,5,"Confusion why they changed to Roman Numerals for this one, but; one step closer than not having to think what you want the phone to do"
398,2,"Too soon to be regretful, but I’m not impressed."
399,5,My husband and I both got the new iPhone X as a Christmas gift to each other. We both are very active and use them for work. They are fast and love the Face ID log in for access and our apps. Camera is amazing and the features create beautiful picture options. Still learning all the great new features but so glad we got them.
400,1,The phone has so many issues. It freezes. The touch sensor goes out so when that happens there’s no access into your phone. ATT has been zero help. This occurred 2 days after I purchased my phone and they will not fix it or exchange it. It lags. There’s just better quality phones than this one.
401,1,Not real impressed. Camera isn’t that great and apps keep locking up.
402,5,The iPhone X is remarkable! It is technically sound and has features second to none. The facial recognition program is the best I’ve seen and it’s superior to the Samsung 8 plus. You won’t regret buying the iPhone X model!
403,4,"Great picture quality, siri sucks, easy, convienient"
404,3,Feel like the phone is good but doesn’t live up to the hype or price.
405,5,I’m not by any means an Apple cult member. I own all PC computers and I detest iTunes witj a passion. I got the iPhone X Because I was due for an upgrade from my 6+. So just to let you know this thing is great. Slightly smaller size I thought I wouldn’t like but it really fits in the hand much better and all the new gestures make this thing great for a single thumb use. And the battery life is amazing. Go ahead spend a lil extra you’ll be glad you did.
406,5,Love the facial recognition over the finger print especially when logging into apps very pleased with the upgrade from the 7 plus
407,5,This one is everything Apple saids it would be. Incredible
408,2,"I am not impressed with this phone. I got it to replace my S6 because it was acting up only to discover they slowed old phones by design. This will be my last iPhone, and likely my last apple product."
409,4,The associate and mobile manager were very helpful.
410,5,Upgraded from an iPhone 6. Love the X! You get used to no having a home button in 20 minutes. Face ID is great. Very fast. No regrets.
411,3,Seems slower than old phone and not as user friendly
412,5,It’s truly and amazing phone I thought it would be horrible but you have to try it out yourself to enjoy it befor you give it bad judgement
413,4,"Was a d bout android user,preferably Samsung.Had so many Robles with my 7edge that I decided to give igneous a try.So far,so good"
414,4,"Great changes. Takes a bit to get use to, however this phone is fabulous!"
415,5,Works great! Like the big screen without the bigger plus model!!
416,1,Phone has a lot of glitches still. AT&T states it’s due to the new operating system. Regret is definitely kicking in...
417,5,Overall like the new phone but just takes a little adjustment learning the new lack of a button.
418,5,Early Xmas gift for my 17 yr old. He loves it. Prticey at $1000 but definitely an eye-catcher.
419,5,"Best camera on a phone. Ever. Caution on the screen, it is the same OLED as the Samsung Galaxy and I would HIGHLY recommend getting the Apple care. It’s $7 a month, and I promise it would be over $300 to get that screen fixed, and that’s if you could find someone who knew what they were do it. Just a thought."
420,5,Excellent phone. long battery life. Smaller phone same screen size
421,5,Didn’t plan on this purchase but stopped to look at new phones. With all the features and the ability to upgrade I bought it and am very happy.
422,5,"I have had my iPhone X for a month now and I love it. For someone who loves Touch ID, the Face ID took some getting used to. Other than that, hopefully this is the direction Apple is going in."
423,5,Very good phone and easy to use. My kids love it .
424,5,Apple really has outdone itself with this phone. It has so many different useful features that Im still learning on how to use them all.
425,5,"Love this phone easy to use, fun to use. The full home screen is the best part of the phone."
426,5,"I'm not the type of person who writes a review about a product after using it for a week unless there is a specific function that I've tested. By the time I've made up my mind it's been 6 months and sometimes writing a review is not worth the trouble. This phone had me convinced after 30 minutes that it's worth it. I haven't been this impressed by a smartphone in years. This phone is Not addicting in the way that you'd be glued to your phone. It's Rather that you won't give this one up and it will quickly become your trusty sidekick. I have ZERO complaints so far. The only reason I went with this over the iPhone 8 plus is because the 8 plus wasn't in stock but after using the iPhone X for 30 minutes I'm glad it wasn't. IMO, the extra money I paid for it is worth it and I believe I will have this phone for 3 years. The look of the screen, the color accuracy, the crispness of the text, and most of all the accuracy of the digitizer are top notch. The input lag is the best I've seen yet from a phone. There is no lag. The feature that I find to be over the top is the facial recognition. I will not have to thumb and paw at my phone to get into it. I have not misspelled any words yet when writing a text. The performance is flawless. The size of the phone is physically the same as the s6 I had been using for years. The reason I'm mentioning a competing brand is because size is a factor people consider when buying a phone. This is certainly a better pick if you have smaller hands but you want a larger screen. The iPhone X fits great in my hands. The final thing I'm happy about is battery life. With BT, WiFi, and location on the phone only used about 25% of it's battery life in a span of 8 hours. In this 8 hours I listened to music for an hour while exercising, set up the phone from scratch, and I downloaded the few apps and music I listen to. In the past I had to run my phones as lean as possible to maximize battery life but now I might be able to run a few extra apps. The final thing to keep in mind is I have about 6 days of seat time using iPhones before buying this one. This is my first iPhone. I found everything easy to use and straightforward. I had zero growing pains going from my previous phone to this one."
427,3,"The phone has much room for improvement. It has locked on my twice. I can be texting and all of a sudden, the screen goes back to the home screen and I have to start over. Closing programs can be a hassle if you don't swipe just right. Sometimes this can take several attempts."
428,5,nice
429,5,Definitely worth the wait! Still discovering all it has to offer.
430,5,"Amazing phone. I love the face recognition, speed and all the features. Best phone I've ever had."
431,4,"The new iPhone is great. Portrait mode for the camera is awesome. However, the GPS does not pick up my exact location which is frustrating when I use it to drive"
432,5,"Bottom Line: The iPhone X is worth the upgrade. Pros: FaceID, Super Retina display, fantastic camera, great design, wireless charging Cons: Some users will miss TouchID Review: I’ve had the iPhone X since launch day, and after a month and a half of use, it makes previous models feel instantly outdated. The full screen is immersive and watching movies on it will make you regret viewing anything on a non-OLED screen. FaceID works really well, and I love that Safari will auto-fill your login details using it. It’s just such a seamless experience. The new camera takes great photos in most situations that will rival an entry level-DSLR. The staineless steel adds some weight, so it’s noticeably heavier than the aluminum series (5-7). FaceID works really well, but it is a little awkward in some situations (e.g., if the phone is on a table, using the phone in landscape mode) that will make some users miss TouchID."
433,5,"I was waiting for the 10th iPhone to come out to upgrade from my iPhone 6. It’s a great phone, and the camera is awesome! The first 2 days I had my iPhone, i was having problems with the Face ID not working and the phone became essentially non-responsive. These issues didn’t occur in cold weather so I wondered if the lighting in the rooms I was in was not sufficient for the iPhone to recognize my face as both issues occurred after 5pm, so it was dark outside. Since there’s no home button, i couldn’t turn the phone off. I watched some You-Tube videos and found one that allowed me to turn the phone off when it doesn’t recognize my face and doesn’t allow a numeric passcode to open up. You push and release the volume up button, then push and release the volume down button, then press and hold the right side button until the phone turns off and the apple logo comes on (after about 10 seconds). Since those first two nights, my iPhone has only locked up the same way once, and using the above reset method, resolved the problem."
434,5,I really enjoy not having a home button. It is a little hard to take a screenshot but the upgrades and new features on the iPhone X are 10/10!
435,5,The iPhone X is the best iPhone to date! All the great new features that come with this phone are fantastic if your due for an upgrade get the X you will not be disappointed. Stand out features: - OLED display - Face ID - Camera - Wireless charging - Fast charging The iPhone X is the best iPhone to date! If you’re thinking about upgrading the iPhone X is highly recommended!
436,5,"I bought this phone for my son. He loves it and he said it took a little while to get used to new motions to do things on the phone, but he likes it very much. The camera is better than previous models."
437,5,Phone is a lot faster and takes great pics and a breeze to use
438,5,"1 month and zero negatives. This is an incredible phone/computer/reader/camera/musicmaker. I am amazed by how great it is and how it works. The lack of home button is not an issue at all. The size and screen size is perfect. Great job, Apple"
439,5,"I purchased this for my girlfriend as an early Christmas present. She was upgrading from a regular 6 and couldn’t be happier. The Face ID feature really is a game changer. If you think you will miss Touch ID, don’t, and here is why... It has a feature that will automatically quiet notifications, rings, and alerts when it knows you’re looking at the phone. Super cool! No need to silence an incoming call right away. Also, whenever you open an app you no longer need to place your finger again. It automatically recognizes that it’s you and unlocks the app. You can also easily reply to a text right on the lock screen because the phone has already recognized that you are the authorized user. The gestures are really simple and accurate. I got myself one too. It was an upgrade from a 7 256GB. I hated the 7. Had issues all the time. This phone solved all of that!"
440,4,"Bigger screen than the ""Plus"" models without the awkward phablet size."
441,5,This phone is very fast and takes awesome pictures!!
442,5,Everything about this phone is fast. Picture quality is awesome!
443,5,Apple has done a great job with the new X it is simple to use and is fast
444,5,He loves it..likes loud speaker and funtions and big screen
445,5,I love my new iPhone X. I had the phone 6S plus and it was too big now this one is snaked and easier to use.
446,5,The cameras take great photos!!!! It’s a lot faster than previous iPhones. It’s smaller than the 8 Plus in size but the screen is larger. I love the wireless charging feature. I got the 256gb for the extra storage!!!
447,5,I love the phone just wish it would recognize 2 faces one for me and one for my wife.
448,5,I am glad I upgraded to the X is is fun and wish it could recognize 2 faces.
449,5,You will I've the new iPhone without a home button. Takes great pictures
450,5,Love this phone. Always been an Apple fan. Love the new features of the x
451,5,I’ve only had my X for a few weeks and haven’t really had time to check out all the features but so far I’m liking everything about this phone...especially the ‘full screen’ view. Makes for easier reading without going to the Plus size which was just too big for my liking ..this one is a great alternative.
452,5,"This is the best iPhone yet, that’s why all the other manufacturers are looking for things bad to say about Apple products, Apple is pulling away from the rest of the competition"
453,5,"I think this is a great product. It is everything you expect from Apple. I love the battery life the most. I dislike that most of the apps are not optimized for the iPhone X, but more and more updates are coming out daily. 64GB is a lot of memory if you use Google Photos to store pictures and movies."
454,5,Best iPhone yet! Love the faceid and the phone is super fast. Very responsive. The screen quality is amazing.
455,5,"My transition to the iPhone X got off to a tough start: I hit update iTunes and my PC before I could move to the new device. However, afterwards, I definitely enjoy the larger form factor, additional storage, and Face ID (which works great for me). Apple came through again when they seamlessly transition from Touch ID on the other phones to Face ID on the iPhone X. I was hesitant about the larger size, but it works great except for carrying the phone in my back pocket."
456,5,This is the best iphone to date. Very fast and clear picture. You quickly adapt to no home button.
457,5,Used the trade in upgrade for my daughter. She loves all the new features. The photo quality is better. Although a smaller phone than the iPhone pluses - the screen is actually larger. All functions are done on the screen vs push button.
458,5,I'm in love with this device and my son will purchase one soon
459,5,This is my first smart phone. I have had it for about two weeks and am completely happy! It can do so much more that make phone calls. I am continuing to learn all about it.
460,5,It takes getting used to the phone without a home button but love the phone overall
461,5,"This is by far the best phone out right now! The operating system is so smooth for daily use, the size is great, and the camera is awesome!"
462,5,I completely love my Iphone X! This is by far the best phone I have ever had. The total feel of the phone is so much better than my previous Iphone plus. I wanted a large screen and that's why I choose the plus but it was too bulky in my pocket at work and hard to hold with one hand. The X gives you the great screen size in a smaller package and so much smoother to use with one hand. The operating system and the daily usage of the phone is a lot smoother as well and the camera takes the best pictures.
463,5,I LOVE my new IPhone X! The facial recognition is awesome & very convenient! So glad I made this purchase.
464,5,I love this phone! It’s camera is amazing and makes every picture look stunning!
465,5,The iPhone x is really fast and it recognizes my face almost instantly and I hope that you enjoy this product to.
466,5,This is the best iPhone yet. The Face ID is fast and effortless. The camera is amazing and the A 11 bionic chip is the fastest chip in any smart phone on the market!
467,5,The feel and the size is very comfortable to hold and use. A lot of people complain about not having a home button or having to get used to not having it. It only took about a day (if that) to get used to the swipe feature. Very good phone and I love the wireless charging.
468,4,Moving from android to iPhone was never going to be easy but I’m now getting use to it. My only disappointment is the apple technology is miles behind android or more specifically samsung.
469,3,It looks great but still has a lot of issues that apple needs to deal with. I have ATT for service and the phone has been unresponsive many times forcing resets. Also if the glass is different and is more resistant to nicks and scratches why do you need the glass protector.
470,5,finally getting closer to competing with android phones but much better quality.
471,5,This phone is amazing! Love all the new features that you get! Make sure you don’t leave the store without a case for it!
472,5,well packaged
473,5,"Why would you go from a 68G to a 200+G without something in the middle? I will NEVER use all the data (but knew I’d be over the 68). Love the screen size, not too hip on the amount of time it takes to unlock the phone"
474,4,The phone is great love it take a little getting used to the functions but worth it.
475,5,Like I said in my first post love this phone. Once you get use to the fact there’s no home button anymore it become one of the best iPhones yet.
476,5,It’s a great iPhone just takes getting use to. Once you get use to the fact there’s no home button anymore it makes everything that much easier.
477,5,I purchased the iPhone X even though I heard reviews of it not being worth the money. I absolutely love this phone. I love that is is less bulky but you have a larger screen. Fits into wristlets where my iPone 6 Plus did not. The face recognition is one of my favorite features. I don’t miss the button! It was a slight learning curve but I love it!
478,5,"After almost two months of using Face ID, it's clear this is one of those innovations that's immediately both intuitive and invisible, and will eventually prove indispensable. It's at it's most convenient when you've got wet fingers, as that would usually result in many failed authentication attempts with Touch ID. However, it's at it's least convenient when wearing the darkest of sunglasses, as authentication fails more often than not (although it's fine with most sunglasses). While on the inconveniences, I've also found that touch-to-wake and raise-to-wake aren't worth the cost to battery life as the phone seems to keep waking while I'm walking around with it in my pocket. This was causing the battery to drain much faster than it should. In order to further optimise battery life I use Smart Invert to convert while backgrounds to black, as the OLED screen should be able to switch off any full-black pixels. Once enabled, triple-pressing the side button toggles it on and off so it's fast to disable it when you need to (it's only moderately ""smart"" so it still inverts the colours in most images). Coming from a 6 Plus, I much prefer the narrower, longer form factor of the X. It's a lot easier to use with one hand. The screen is also noticeably better, particularly viewing photos and videos. However, perhaps the most significant improvement is in the camera. While it struggles in low light, or zooming into long distance, in most situations it takes extremely good photos. Rather than bemoan the loss of the headphone jack, I've taken the opportunity to pair the iPhone X with BeatsX wireless earphones. Similar to the change from Touch ID to Face ID, now it's hard to imagine going back. Overall, the iPhone X is an amazing device. Given how much we rely on our smartphones, to me it's been well worth the investment."
479,4,"Screen size wonderful. Color of phone, Love. Easy keys when dialing. Slim enough to fit in pocket of pants without being too bulky."
480,4,I Switched from Android to Apple. The reliability on my IPhone is much better. I’m glad I made the switch
481,5,It does what ever you want it to do. I enjoy it I recommend
482,5,"iPhone X is a pretty good phone. I’m having issues with my visual voicemail, but I think that’s a software issue, other than that nice phone."
483,5,This is an amazing phone. The new features are stellar!
484,5,The larger screen is great. The size of phone is perfect. Only bad thing is you have to learn how to do functions all over again.
485,5,Does everything advertised. Face recognition is amazing. A few changes to get used to (no home button anymore)
486,5,"Love the face unlock, True Tone display, I will say is a much better screen conpare to my old iPhone 6s."
487,5,Easy to get everything transferred and going. Nice pictures and getting us to no home button was easier than expected.
488,5,My daughter Loves this phone & all the different features..
489,5,"Another great apple product, not having the home button is taking a lot to get use to but overall a great phone!"
490,5,Apple comes through again! The Apple X is everything I thought it would be and more! Great device!
491,5,Always Apple provides best smartphones. I definitely recommend to my friends.
492,4,This a great phone and I love the quality of the photos.
493,5,I surprisingly like the iPhone X coming from a iPhone 7plus. Even though it’s a smaller phone it has a equally large screen. And the camera is awesome
494,5,"This is my third iPhone, and there are great new features. It’s user friendly, very responsive. The only downside is the (provided) adapter needed to connect the earbuds."
495,5,"Bought 3 if these as upgrades for our kids phones. Needless to say, we’re now the best Dad and Mom on the planet."
496,5,Love the iPhone X. So much fun to use. Not having a home button is great!
497,5,What’s not to love!?! Totally enjoying my new iPhone.
498,5,Fast clean clear love this phone. Worth the price.
499,5,This phone is awesome the price is a little high but well worth it!
500,5,Absolutely best phone I’ve ever owned !!! And I have owned a lot of them...
501,5,Great phone super fast love the screen and love the compact phone with the large display
502,5,iphone X features an all-screen design with a 5.8-inch Super Retina HD display with HDR and True Tone. Designed with the most durable glass ever in a smartphone and a surgical grade stainless steel
503,4,Amazing portrait filter for both cameras! Facial recognition is absolutely amazing! The only downside is the size of the phone itself!
504,5,"Great for me but it’s smaller than the plus that I had. Disappointed in the screen size though, even though it’s bigger when videos play they are the same size as my previous 6 plus"
505,3,"At first I was a little hesitant to buy this phone because it was it was so expensive but with the investment I had already made with apple I figured I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. While it is true that many of the touted features (face rec, wireless charge, etc) are a nice to have, they have been around for some time now. I, like thousands of others, are disappointed in the lack of a headphone jack but am making due with some bose earbuds I bought with it. At any rate, my initial feedback is good but I do not see the cutting edge technology that Apple is known showing up in this phone. Dont get me wrong, it is a great phone but so are the other phones in this ""class"" of premium phones."
506,5,I’ve only had this iPhone X for three days but it was easy to get used to. I have noticed that the battery last longer than my previous iPhone 6.
507,5,"Originally had no desire to upgrade to the iPhone X, but it’s by far the best iPhone released to date."
508,4,Been excited about this iPhone I upgraded from a 6plus so I definitely was do for an upgrade. I wanted a whole different iPhone than all the previous ones they all pretty much look the same to me. So like I said I went from a plus to this n I must say even though the screen is bigger on this new iPhone I liked the screen on the plus it’s wider n when texting the keyboard ain’t as crammed. Another thing is the whole swipe is totally different then regular iPhones. I hate the whole closing of apps seemed easier to do on other iPhones. Plus had to YouTube how to screen shot since there’s no button. It’s a whole learning experience. I miss my plus
509,5,"the iphone x is amazing. it has great camera loud and clear speakers and best of all, long battery life..."
510,5,"Nice camera, bigger screen and easier to carry, Love the face recognition"
511,5,"Don’t listen to what the tech review site says, this new Apple iPhone X has completely redesign not only what the new standard of edge to edge display should be on a phone but also the new way users interact with their smart phones. Apple sets the standard when they introduce the home button for the first smartphone in the world, and now they are first to introduce no home button for smart phone user interface. The new flow is also so much quicker because we no longer tap on the screen to perform action we now also swipe and slide which means the swipe up to go home is a natural flow. Face ID is also how the fastest way to unlock the phone and performing and ID verification. These two features are what sets this phone apart from the rest of the competitor and no doubt will be the new standard moving forward."
512,5,"Best iPhone yet they really got everything right. Steep price but, worth it in the end."
513,5,"Love the new iPhone. Easy to use, intuitive ... such a joy to use."
514,5,"Not sure what I can say about it. If you’ve always had an iPhone this is a major improvement. If you coming from android, welcome and enjoy. The simplicity of the iPhone makes your life easier."
515,5,The camera has so may options the pictures are much better than the IPhone 7
516,5,"It’s not perfect but then again, it comes pretty close to it. Closer then anyone else. Love it. Not really happy about the battery percentage not being displayed but I’ve learned to live with it. Small learning curve with the new gestures but very easy to get used to and within the first few hours you’ll feel at home with it. Recommend."
517,5,This is a great iPhone to have. It might take a little getting used to with the new swiping gestures but very easy to learn!
518,5,There is a bit of a learning curve at first with the lack of a home button but overall apple delivers! The facial recognition is super convenient and the gestures make you feel like you are more in control. The pictures it takes are beautiful. Hands down the best iPhone yet!
519,5,Love this phone face recognition is pretty cool just have to get use to the size
520,5,This was a gift for my daughter She really likes it The Samsung app doesn’t let her watch work as well as her Samsung phone
521,5,This phone is amazing. It literally is a small computer. The possibilities are endless.
522,5,"Great item! High quality, looks great. Easy process. Love my new phone!"
523,5,"Upgraded from 6plus to iPhone 10. Pretty much same interface, just with a new face lift. Love the new design. Only took a few hours to get use to gesture."
524,5,This phone is awesome. There is a small learning curve with the home button being removed.
525,5,Great camera and I love Face ID which is more secure than Touch ID
526,5,There's a bit of learning this phone since I was use to Samsung. I like it a lot and it's getting easier. Perfect size phone. No problems so far.
527,5,Oh gosh! I’ve been waiting for this time! I finally got the iPhone X! A great product! It’ll change your life!
528,5,Gave a 5 working great does what I want love the color and right size
529,5,I am loving this phone. It is way faster and responsive than my iPhone 6
530,5,Always owned IPhones but this one seems to be the best yet
531,5,I love this phone even though I do not know how to fully use it yet it’s awesome
532,5,Very happy with our new iPhone X. Love the face recognition. Its very accurate
533,5,Love our new phones!! They made the change very easy
534,4,"Great smartphone by a great company. Can’t help but to acknowledge it is certainly overpriced, especially considering that there is not many essential accessories in the box. Also, sometimes apps freeze and one has to restart the phone. The 5 watt charger that is included is sure underwhelming. The face recognition technology is fairly great though. I would recommend the iPhone X over many other alternatives."
535,5,Takes a little getting used to but it is worth it.
536,5,"This phone is awesome, design, performance, battery life, sounds, you name it. Best phone I've owned hands down!"
537,4,It's a little complicated to figure out all of the new functions and to get over using things i'm used to.
538,5,I am so happy that I got this phone. It is even better than I expected.
539,5,I love my new iPhone X. It is smaller in my hand than the 7 Plus I had prior but I quickly adapted and wouldn’t go back. Must have!
540,5,I’ve always had android phones. After seeing one of these in person I couldn’t resist. Absolutely love it. Camera is amazing.
541,5,The phone is good. Only problem I have with the phone is that it’s small thought they would have a plus size for it but other then that it’s good.
542,4,"I've read a bunch of negative reviews that were obviously from people that didn't take a few simple steps to ensure the transition to a new technology went as flawless as possible. So let's start with FaceID. When setting it up, don't hold it straight out in front of you like you're taking a selfie, instead try to hold the phone as close as you can to the normal spot you would hold it for daily use. Seems simple right? Most don't think about that, which is why they have issues with recognition. I even took an extra precaution to shave my face before setting it up, being that I go from clean shaved to full beard several times throughout the year it made sense to do it. I also turned off the setting that requires eye contact with the phone, knowing that I wear sunglasses, including polarized lenses that would hinder the phones ability to see my eyes, to streamline the process of unlocking my phone. I don't have anything to hide from anyone close to me so there's no need to worry about the top tier security FaceID settings. Also if I were to misplace my phone I can easily find and/or wipe the device from a friends phone or a laptop via iCloud. The point of all this is taking those extra few steps setting up the FaceID and toning down the security a pinch, I now unlock my device faster than touchID ever did. Getting the hang of the new gestures and locations of said gestures sure helps too. Speaking of new gestures, a simple Google and/or Youtube search will teach you every new gesture and feature of the X in less than 8 minutes. So there's that. Another thing I never really understood was everyones lack of knowledge about apples Family Sharing program available to every iDevice. If you have a significant other, or an entire family using apple products, take advantage of this service. While I'm on the subject, why spend hundreds more on a phone for the top storage when you can pay $3/month for 200GB of iCloud storage. I don't have a single photo/video/music file on my phone, all of it instantly goes in the cloud, which is easy to manage from a computer if you ever come close to filling that space. I have the 64GB iPhone X and only use 21GB currently, including the 8GB of system software. Most of the space I've filled is with apps, books, and messages. I also take advantage of Apple Music family plan. I don't use any other music service anymore, and I've tried them all. I do all of this on the 8GB VZW data plan with only myself and SO on the plan. If you plan ahead and download items you may want in the near future over wifi, then you'll have it during the time you can't or don't want to use cell service. It's not that difficult folks. Save yourself some time and money with a little thinking and planning. The design of the iPhone X is beautiful, I love the smaller size, never was a fan of the plus sized phones. The battery is fine but could be better, I've optimized my settings to prolong battery life and I'm down to 10-20% by the time I get in bed after a day of medium to heavy use. The notch will disappear after a week or two, unless you are a weird ocd freak out when your pencil is sitting on the desk at 1 degree off vertical. I like it to be honest. If you're uncertain about trying the iPhone X get on Youtube and watch several thorough reviews, and go to a store to try it out yourself. If you do that, you should know within a few minutes of handling it whether or not you will enjoy it. Other than FaceID, ""The notch"", loss of home button, addition of new gestures it's basically the same as every other iPhone. Take your time and be patient. If you hate it, you hate it, that's that. Keep this in mind, this phone is the first of it's kind in a new direction that Apple has taken. It's going to have issues, and people are going to hate change. Just the way it is. I've tried every single phone operating system. Seriously, I've had a windows phone, a blackberry, a motorola, a samsung, nokia etc etc, all of which were great in their own ways and horrible in others. iOS is by far the most streamlined and secure os out. I..."
543,5,the best iphone ever made. a great phone at an extreme value.
544,4,Bought at Amazon store with great help from salesman. Got unlocked to use with my company account - simple activation. Phone itself is awesome with Face ID and an incredible screen. Decent battery life thus far :)
545,5,Love the large screen in the same size phone. Best iPhone yet
546,5,"I’m a huge iPhone fan, and love the new features of this phone, especially wireless charging and FaceID"
547,5,I really like the new features on this phone. Camera quality is great
548,4,Great phone with a lot of extras. It's awfully pricey. I am concerned that maybe Apple dialed back the speed on the old phone I had in order to sell the newer products. Great customer service from Best Buy
549,5,The phone is great with many excellent features. It was easy to set up and transfer data/photos from my older iPhone 6. Only tricky thing was understanding how to transfer my existing service but a quick web search got that taken care of.
550,5,I absolutely love this phone. The cameras are awesome!!
551,5,I absolutely love this phone! I’ve had it just over a week and I was used to everything new within a day except the feature where you have to hold an app before swiping up to hard close them. My new favorite feature besides Face ID is the portrait mode in the camera and the upgraded cameras!
552,5,Wow!!Great phone and I’m still learning new features!! Wow!! Expensive!! Not sur yet if it’s worth the extra cash but I am enjoying it if I can just remember that there is no home button!
553,5,I love my new cell phone. It took time to learn all the new features. But with the help of Google and the awesome Best Buy employees I have learned how to use my new phone.
554,5,I love this phone. It has an amazing camera and the screen resolution is amazing. Took a minute to get used to no Home button but now would not go back to a button
555,5,The best iPhone ever made. The best camera on a phone and at a tremendous value.
556,5,I’m a apple product person and I enjoy my upgrade. Now I’m talking with Family and Friends about the latest apple products
557,5,Went from 6+ to x. Love love love. Only took a few minutes to transition with the changes. The new size is great. Basically same screen size as the 6+ but easier to hold.
558,5,At first its hard cause were all used to the button in the bottom but in 1 day of usage you get used to it. Overall phone great
559,5,Coming from a iPhone 6 with only 64 gb it was a huge step into the world of amazing technology with the Face ID and animojis and live pictures I love it
560,5,I really enjoy the Animoji I can send to my kids when there having a bad day in school to cheer them up and it’s a great piece of technology for when I need to take a picture
561,5,"Being an “Apple” Person, naturally I got the iPhone X. Not a bad thing to say about it."
562,4,"This phone is what it is, another iPhone. It operates the same as my old one for an extra $500."
563,5,My wife really likes it a lot I would recommend it
564,5,I went from the 7 Plus to the X and am happy with the results.
565,5,Best phone I have purchased..highly recommended much better to use than Samsung 8+
566,5,"The updated features are awesome. Same phone, different name though."
567,5,I like the phone. I thought it came with airpods. only disappointed part
568,4,"All in all a great pocket computer. There are a few things which take getting used to, but nothing I’d consider a dealbreaker. App developers haven’t yet fully embraced the design to allow for the notch, but I’m sure they’ll catch up. Meanwhile the workaround is to simply flip the phone and you can use hidden buttons. FaceID leaves a bit to be desired, I don’t always want to assume the position to open my phone."
569,5,"When I saw the first ad for the iPhone X I was like I want that phone. Now that I have had it since the release date I love it but at first I was like oh my what have I done.but I’m happy I stayed with the x. People complain apps are not setup to take full advantage of the x , sadly they knew this going in. Yeah it’s not as big as my 7 plus but you know over all it seems to be a way better phone. The call clarity is amazing. The battery life last a full 2 days for me. The screen is breath taking. And people keep saying the phone is fragile I don’t see it I have dropped mine from waist height about 6 times not even a scratch or crack"
570,5,"I have been using my iPhone X for about 4 weeks. It is the best and fastest iPhone on the market. I am amazed by its screen - no other iPhones can beat it. It is so fast. No delays to open apps on it. I love it, although I have to admit it is quite expensive."
571,5,This is my second iPhone ever.! And I must say this iPhone X has really stood up to its hype. The battery life is amazing and the extra screen size is really nice. You get used to the small center screen cutout.
572,5,"a nice upgrade from the iPhone 6s Plus, couldnt be happier."
573,5,"I have just gone from an iPhone 4s to the iPhone X. It is like learning all over again what a iPhone can do. With the help of my granddaughters (10 & 12) I now feel pretty comfortable with the new iPhone X. However, there's still a number of things I need to learn before I consider myself confident to explain them to others."
574,5,my son had to have it for xmas and its a good phone but didnt live up to the hype for this exclusivity that they were trying to sell
575,5,"The iPhone X definitely meets my expectations. It’s certainly a lot smaller than the 8 plus, but if you think about it the bezels are the size difference between the 8 plus and the X. Battery life is awesome, but it is my first day using it so I’ll see how it tapers off with use. Face ID works like a CHARM. Quick and easy. Very satisfied with Verizon’s network too, speedy and reliable. Overall I am one very happy satisfied customer!"
576,5,"I purchased the iPhone X last month and I'm not disappointed with any of the changes or upgrades from my iPhone 6. Th picture quality is much better, it's much faster and with Face ID you access it instantly."
577,4,The size is great bigger screen than 7plus but overall smaller phone. Difficult to get used to no home button.
578,5,Love it and try to ignore how much it cost. Purchased on vacation so sightless cheaper. After picking up old iPhone 6s the new screen feels worlds better on the new phone. While the new X is noticeably heavier than the 6s the new iPhone X feels more solid and looks super chic.
579,4,So I have had my iPhone X for two months now and I love it. It took me a little time to adjust to the changes like closing apps is different and the zoom in and out still annoys me but overall the battery lasts the larger screen is good and it is quick too to open and close browsing windows.
580,5,I love this phone. It is super smooth and not having the home button has already been forgotten. I love the big screen.
581,5,This phone was a Christmas present for my teenage son which is an upgrade from iPhone 6s plus. He loves it. Great sounds and excellent picture quality.
582,5,"I love my new phone. The phone has streamlined features and new features that make it easier to use. The picture quality is excellent. You still get the big screen without all of the extra phone size so the phone is much easier to handle, even with a case."
583,5,This is my first new phone since the iPhone 6. It’s also the first new phone since the 6 that I thought had enough new features to warrant a new phone. Face ID is awesome.
584,4,The size of the phone is perfect. Only bad thing is that you need to learn how to use it all over again.
585,5,"Coming from previous generations of iPhones, I was skeptical on upgrading to an iPhone without Touch ID and no home button. All I can say I am glad I did it! The Face ID works much better than I even imagined! Even better than Touch ID! I also don’t miss the home button. It will take less than a day to get used to the swiping. It’s a great iPhone!"
586,5,"I have always used iPhones and the ""X"" is the best iPhone yet..."
587,1,"It's Terrible. Everyone that I speak to (on the phone) says that it sounds as if I am underwater before the crackling begins and I have to hang up . Now, I have to return the phone within the 2 week window of purchase which is a real inconvenience for me as I have a broken leg that I can't bear any weight on."
588,5,"Fast, amazing display, great camera, and handles all apps and games smoothly."
589,5,This new iPhone is awesome. The speed and the facial recognition as well as the new screen make it a great upgrade from my old phone
590,5,This has all the latest bells and whistles...but getting use to not having a hoe button is a challenge...once you get over that it's all good
591,4,This is a good product for Apple fans. I was looking for a bigger and larger screen device say like 8 plus size with full edge to edge screen.
592,5,"I’ve had pretty much every iPhone going back to the original one. I love this new model. The Face ID works even when it’s dark in the room. Of course the screen on the phone is great. I do miss having a big iPhone, but I’m a big fan of this one"
593,5,This product is awesome! Love the facial opening it is fast!
594,5,I am a gadget lover. I am still finding new things about this phone.
595,5,so far so good...love the phone. still exploring..
596,5,My wife loves her new iPhone X. She loves the camera the most. Much faster too!
597,5,"There are two sides, the apple fan and the non-apple fan. I happen to be in the middle but love this purchase. Great features, love the camera."
598,5,Works well and good reception. Would but again needed.
599,5,Slight learning curve but actually feel the phone is more user friendly and intuitive
600,5,"This is an amazing phone, with amazing technology! The screen is mesmerizing and it is very intuitive to navigate. Camera is great, and all the apps work well. I love this phone and recommend it to everyone!"
601,5,This phone is the best iPhone yet. Great picture quality.
602,2,More hype than substance. While the facial recognition system is nice performance is lacking. Phone connection is not clear. Have many complaints that I can not be heard when calling others compared to my old iPhone 7plus. Despite the hype screen size is underwhelming. Improvement on the top & bottom of screen is ineffective when watching video. Width significantly smaller than iPhone 7+ that impacts reading. (See Photo). Best feature is the camera that allows greater control. Multiple consumer reviews state it is the most breakable phone ever. Finally uying experience was dreadful. Miss days when customer service personal instead of dropped internet connections. Plans that promote free upgrades are worthless when new phones work less effectively than ones they replace.
603,4,The absence of the home button is one thing. Takes a day or two to get used to...other wise a nice fast phone but worth the money....I guess we’ll see.
604,5,While not the most impressive thing in the market for us iPhone fans it’s greatest so far. Personally iPhones are the only type of cellular device I use.
605,5,I’ve only been in the iPhone life since the 6s but holy wow the 7 plus was ok the 8 wasn’t much of a upgrade in my eyes even though it had the same internals as the X but man I tell you what the X is gonna give it to ya everything you want great battery life amazing photos it’s got it all the size is amazing granted some apps aren’t optimized for it yet but I don’t care I can adapt until they are ready the Face ID I didn’t know about at first but it’s great
606,5,Easy setup face unlocked real cool after almost a month I still learning. But learning is fun. Version tried to telling me Samsung note was better but when I saw the size it’s way to large to use as phone or even put in pocket way to large. But nothing better than iPhone X.
607,4,"I just notice that sometimes the system froze. and i want to review the design of the physical phone. It is sometimes confusing which is top or bottom. Maybe i just used to the previous iphone style that there is a home button. Iphone x doesnt have home button but it screen design on top, the curve, for me is not good. I think it is better if the style of the top and bottom is the same. Just straight. I think they maximise the space."
608,5,The camera is great and the new emojis are fun to play around with.
609,4,I am happy with look and battery life of my new iPhone. I do miss the home button. It was hard to get used to the new setup. Facial recognition is cool when it works for me.
610,5,"I was skeptical at first with the face ID, I remembered the early days of touch ID and Apple pay and hated it. A few days of using the iPhone X, face ID works all the time and the swiping from the bottom comes naturally. Love the bigger screen yet it is only slightly bigger than my old iPhone 7, there are people like me who does not like phablet. A little pricey but worth it!"
611,5,"Great upgrade from an iPhone 6S. In terms of UI it's the exact same as any other iPhone but that's what I love, consistency."
612,5,I always have the best shopping at Best Buy always give me the best deals with the price match
613,3,"Overall pretty good. Nothing extravagant. If you are accustomed to an iPhone plus, I certainly would not recommend. The full screen feature is overrated and pretty much for the home screen and some videos on you tube. If the X came as a plus, I'd certainly get it. I think the advertisement for the full screen effect is misleading."
614,5,So glad I made the choice to get this phone. Best phone ever.
615,5,I’m loving this phone so far! Perfect size and fits in my pocket.
616,5,"This is my 3rd Iphone. I switched carriers from Sprint to ATT. So I decided to upgrade. Once past the learning curve this phone is relatively easy to use. Phone holds a charge throughout day, fast charges on the Samsung fast change, and color display is sharp. I probably could have been just as happy with the iphone 8, but the facial recognition is a revolutionary feature. This phone is smaller and very sleek, I really don’t miss the larger sized S plus or the weight or the battery life usage. Swiping is very easy and I don’t miss the finger button with facial recognition. I do recommend supplemental case and screen protection. Check out tutorials on Youtube and Apple. For all things said and done, I think, “it’s worth it .”"
617,4,"The much anticipated iPhone X, it's a nice product to show off but the face ID still needs some fine tuning. Overall it is slick and a good direction to go since it seems like the future iPhones will be buttonless."
618,5,I love the X. It’s lightning fast with lots of memory. A week into use I had a SIM card failure which was replaced by att.
619,5,"Are all apple products over priced? Yes, but this iPhone is a game changer. The gestures are easy to understand after playing with it for a few hours. A full screen on a mid-size phone is awesome. Finally wireless charging to iPhone. Great build quality."
620,5,Just have to get used to no home button but the clarity is amazing vibrant colors really fast processor
621,3,"Im honestly not very impressed with this phone. I was under the impression Apple was designing this phone with the ability to essentially be used as a computer, with connectivity to a keyboard and display. This is not a feature I would use often or is of great importance, but it is innovation and could help support the price of this. Additionally, why make this in all glass? (Aside from the fact that it will boost accessory sales as well as repair revenue). This phone still acts glitchy and I got the unlocked version with 256GB memorory. The unlocked version has 4GB of RAM vs the traditional iPhone X models (Carrier Specifict Models). You can research this to confirm if you doubt this is correct. I am at the point where I might just return the phone and either choose another alternative such as the Google2 phone or the BlackBerry KeyOne. My life is cluttered enough, sometimes getting back to basics is most important. Especially when the difference in price is $700.00!"
622,5,I love this phone! The camera takes such great pictures. The video quality is great as well. Best iPhone to date!
623,5,Its the future of iPhone. It's everything its described as being. Awesome display. Premium build quality. Premium finish. The list goes on and all. If your coming from a plus you will have to adjust to the new width but no big deal
624,5,Wonderful phone love it using it is so easy and simple better than iPhone 6plus
625,5,I purchased this for my husband and he loves the phone.
626,5,This is the best IPhone to date. iOS runs fast and bug free. The picture quality is upgraded with lighting and picture editing features not previously available. Beautiful display and design.
627,5,"I went to bestbuy to buy the iPhone x and I met David R. He helped me get approved for a plantium bestbuy credit card. He was such a great help, knew exactly what he was talking about, answered all my questions, has excellent customer service, very friendly and out going! I would recommend all my friends to him! Thanks so much for your help. And thank you Cary bestbuy for such friendly staff. I have been shopping here for a long time and I will continue to do so!"
628,5,Apple always produces a great product. That’s why they are so successful!
629,4,Not perfect but better screen real estate and camera. Easy phone and voice keep me with apple
630,5,Great phone with great apps. I recommend the 256G you will use the phone alot.
631,3,So I’m a Mac person and have a strong Mac ecosystem and this device is actually for my kid for Christmas but I played around with it to test it out and the display is great but the Face ID is kinda slow and hard to read at night or if you have something on you head. The phone is good overall just not worth the price especially with Apple beta testing this from its end users to come out with something better next year. Wait for the new one next year if you can.
632,4,My favorite thing is the camera. It takes wonderful pictures even at a great distance.
633,4,love the phone but next time i will be ordering in store had problems an stress online
634,5,"Perfect size, smaller than the plus but bigger than the regular. Faster on speed. Could have used different color on back glass"
635,5,"The previous 2 smart phones we had were Samsung (latest Galaxy S6). I got tired of reinstalling apps on my wife's phone after an Android upgrade. Also, my wife got proficient with reconnecting to the home WiFi after an Android upgrade. So far we have had one Apple OS upgrade and no issues except my wife had problems telling the OS that she did NOT want to use Apple Pay..."
636,2,"This is by far the best IPhone so far. I love everything about it, it is so smooth and so awesome to use! I am so happy that I have this phone and I recommend anyone that is deciding between the IPhone 8 and the IPhone X to get this phone! Actually, I recommend android users to switch to this phone, it is much better!! Oh and the speed is AMAZING, so fast!"
637,5,The Ferrari of phones . Pure luxury. A bycyle for the mind
638,5,"Love love my new phone. I was hesitant at first, but so happy with this beautiful phone."
639,5,I Love all these new features of the new iPhone “x”
640,5,The customer service was good they Got me the phone in no time.
641,4,I think I miss the home button. At least Siri is more responsive than she was on my 6plus. Not worth the extra expense just for the “new emoji” and the portrait camera which I use sparingly
642,5,Best phone ever owned so far I have gotten used to it fast
644,5,Nice! I actually like the smaller feel with the full screen.
645,5,No home button = no problem! Emojis are fun. The processor is amazing! Best iPhone Apple has ever made!
646,5,"Great phone, fast and has a lot of cool options. The face recognition program is fun."
647,5,I’ve owned every iteration of iPhone. I can easily say that without a doubt this is the phone we’ve been waiting for. From the full screen to the animoji’s and 4K Video. This is the one.
648,4,Bought a 8 Plus and a X. The 8 Plus was the first product I ever recommended not to buy based on the price versus improvements. The X has more improvements but has even a higher price. I actually like the simple improvements and was easy to figure it out. ( I’m old and not tech savvy) If you have the money it’s nice
649,5,"The next generation phone, best choice for younger"
650,5,Apple did it again. This phone has awesome battery life and the screen wows
651,5,I love this phone so far. It’s smart!!! Both cameras are magnificent and the battery life is a lot better than previous phones. Display is exceptional also.
652,5,Its a gift for my sister and she should be the one to review :p
653,5,The camera is phenomenal. I am ecstatic about all of its capabilities.
654,5,I thought that the X would be hard to operate because I had become really accustomed to the 6 Plus and didn’t really utilize that device to the full capacity but I am enjoying getting acclimated with the latest technology that Apple has released with the X. It’s definitely a great toy to have.
655,4,I absolutely loved this phone at first. I have been in the Apple store twice and on the phone 2 times. After I had to wipe everything off my phone and started over I am trying to fall in love again.
656,5,best purchase for the year. animated emoji best part of this version.
657,5,Great great great great great great great great great
658,3,"Upgraded from a 5s, huge upgrade. Too many bugs, Pandora makes it soft restar CONSTANTLY, the lock screen tends to disappear CONSTANTLY... things you wouldn’t expect from a $1,200+ phone."
659,4,Everything as advertised. Great phone and pics. Still exploring the fun things to do. Only wish that Best Buy would have included activation instructions for my upgraded phone. I was able to figure it out on my own but it just would have made things a little simpler
660,5,I love the phone. Apple has make another fine product.
661,5,It takes a awhile to get used to no buttons. It has a awesome screen
662,5,Love camera. Love swiping love not having home button.
663,5,The anniversary iPhone X is the best of breed. It has truly awesome specs. The price is equal to the quality and performance - high. but work every penny
664,5,I love this iPhone and like the Face ID feature. Also the pictures clarity is phenomenal. The volume of the ring sound lowers as soon as you look at it and it recognizes your face which is great too.
665,4,"In fact I thought I would have a way better camera, but is not a big deal. I may go visit a technician t see if my is working well"
666,5,I love the iPhone X - the size is the perfect blend of the regular and the plus! - all then new features are great! - Got one for the wife too!!!
667,5,Apple just outdid themselves with the IPhone X !!!
668,5,"I upgraded from a 6S Plus and the iPhone X is better in every way. The cameras are amazing and even rivials my DSLR, Display is stunning, Augmented Reality Aps work surprisingly well."
669,5,Love this phone! Worth it and trade in program great
670,5,"I want to say that I have read reviews about the face id working sometime, but mine works all the time. I came from Windows phone and as expected I have lost the great synchronization windows phone had with my other windows product, desktop, laptop and surface. So that is painful that I now need to update information in at least 2 places, but even though the interface or OS is long in the tooth for Apple, the fact things work well is and always has been their ace in the hole. This phone has grest responsiveness and works well for me."
671,5,"Love it. A little different from the 6, but so easy to use"
672,5,Best smartphone ever from Apple. The camera and the Animoji’s is my favorite
673,1,this phone is not an improvement.I liked my iPhone 6 better the home button was better but the class cracked and the battery was going.
674,5,By far the best iPhone made to date. Transition to face recognition and lack of home button was super easy and took very little time to adjust to. Simply awesome!
675,4,Great upgrade from iphone 7 pluse. Takes good picture.
676,5,"Finally an all new iPhone , this phone is packed with a lot of hi tech features."
677,5,"Amazing new phone ,I love all the new features. The facial recognition is my favorite."
678,5,"Apple has never disappointed specially with this new version. Great phone, great camera"
679,4,"Overall this is a great phone. I didn’t give it 5 stars because the learning curve, it’s not necessarily bad but the iPhone X had to change a few controls due to no home button and the edge to edge screen. Other than that this is an excellent phone."
680,5,This is amazing phone in the market. Love the new looking I bought 2 of them for my family
681,5,The camera take better picture; love the no home button
682,5,No home button is a little adjustment but all over great phone
683,5,He is going to love it! His old phone won’t charge much anymore. This should work!
684,5,My husband loves the iPhone X Best Buy guy made it easy to purchase
685,5,"Loving this new phone; upgraded from 7 series. Fast, gorgeous display and liking the wireless charging."
686,5,The facial recognition works great even in the dark. Apple sent me an email as soon as I got the phone showing how to use the new features of the X. Great service that Apple provided. Made getting use to it much easier. The X was a very good upgrade from my 7.
687,5,"Since iPhones came out I have had many models over the years. Not surprisingly , this is the best. Beautifully designed with a really bright and clear screen. Far superior battery life too."
688,5,I am an Apple fan and have had an iPhone forever. The iPhone X is a clear winner. I love the bigger screen and the way you can get from page to page. Hard to believe that someday they will improve on this!
689,5,"Easy to use, comfortable to carry, powerful and fast (96 Mb/sec on 100 Mb/sec WIFI. Camera has awesome capabilities - still learning all it's features. The transition from the iPhone6 was easy...no glitches."
690,4,Takes some getting used to vs home button models. Camera is excellent. Still just an iPhone.
691,5,I especially like the improved camera and the display.
692,4,"takes a bit to get used to no home button, dont mind the bar on the screen. this has a learning curve."
693,4,Nice phone. Alot faster than my 6S. the screen is taller but narrower however. No zoom features for the apps.
694,4,The camera on this phone is AMAZING!! Finally Apple got it right!!! I wish there would have been a large phone option but hear the next launch will include a larger option so you might want to wait. This phone is expensive!!
695,5,"My wife loves her new Iphone X. Super fast and looks great. Not too big of a phone, but definitely has a big screen to look at."
696,4,Husband wanted to upgrade he’s a happy guy. Only thing is the phone is smaller then a plus.
697,4,"The only negative is the phone doesn't have a larger size option, but this phone is MUCH better than the previous versions."
698,5,"Upgraded from a 6s. Love the face recognition. Using the phone is different without a home button, but easy to get used to. I had to google a few things like how to shut it down, screen shots, and how to close apps. The face recognition with Apple Pay is very cool. Face recognition doesn’t work unless your eyes are open and you are looking at the phone. So it feels more private than with the fingerprint scanner. I chose the silver phone because it looked awesome. But the front and rear of the phone are glass. And it is super slippery. So I looked for a clear silicone case to show off the phone but also keep it safe. Overall very happy with the new iPhone."
699,5,Great phone notch doesn’t bother me. Got use to the phone in two days. I’m happy
700,3,"Tons of features but impossible to share with people that have not equal technology. Impossible to upload on Instagram or FB great videos, too heavy. The camaras are great but when using block itself and I needed to shut down completly the cell and restart to continue using. So, too expensive and it works so-so. Not very happy."
701,5,"I love my iPhone X- 256GB, very easy to use and so much faster then my other iPhones I have used in the past."
703,5,Love this new phone. The picture quality and face recognition features are awesome.
704,5,AMAZING PHONE BEST SCREEN ON THE MARKET. BUY NOW!!
705,5,Don’t upgrade every year—just wait for the big changes—and this one is it!
706,5,This is great buy. My old phone was dropping calls and the battery was bad. No issues with this one.
707,5,I love my iPhone X! It takes amazing pictures and love the fact that I have the whole screen
708,5,This is the best phone what I have ever . It’s very quick make good picture and of course have more room . And plus battery it’s forever !
709,5,I've had iphones since the first iphone and this is phone is like 10 levels up from any other iphone.
710,2,Difficult and slower to open my apps and get where I need to go. Very aggravated with it daily. Wish had gone with a 8 plus. Size is great. Very Unhappy!
711,5,The iPhone 10 is very user friendly with plenty of useful features
712,4,"I had the iPhone 3, 4, 5 and then 6. I decided that was smart enough for a smart phone and I didn’t need any new phone. Temptation got the better of me and now I have the new iPhone X. Frankly I have no regrets. The new Face ID feature works great and apparently more secure than finger ID. With the Home button missing, it does take a little getting used to, but no more than couple of days. You don’t need to read extensive product manual to make the most of the phone. Just search on YouTube for top 10 iPhone X feature, and you will know most of what you need to know. The battery life is great (I understand it has two batteries packed inside) and the camera is great too. It has one of the fastest processor of any smart phone on the market and the latest OLED screen is really good. Just be careful you don’t drop the phone and crack the screen as it can set you back about $500. Is it value for money? I am not so sure about that. I think it’s a bit too pricey for a smart phone and for that reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars."
713,5,"I have had the phone a week, and it seems great!"
714,5,"My girlfriend and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6. The X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth. The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it. The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are. The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger. If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too. The Face ID works really well. Being brothers that look a lot alike we try to trick it but it doesn’t work. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well. Camera takes awesome pictures. The 256g model can hold a lot of data which is nice and since your spending a grand you might as well spend the extra money and get the extra memory Pleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. In all fairness though, I could get by just fine with the iPhone 7 that I have been using. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you’ll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome. Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It’s a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don’t get dinged up."
715,4,this is a decent phone. My son really likes it and it has many great features.
716,5,This is best iphone to ever come out. It’s simple.
717,3,"Hhhmmm... After a long, excited wait to finally go in and get it, I’m not as impressed as I expected to be. Coming from a 6s Plus 64gb, I don’t feel like this is an “upgrade”. Pros: smaller, huge storage space, louder speakers Cons: smaller, difficult to get used to the changes in function, can’t stand the function to return to/view previous screen(s), glass housing stresses me out (always feeling like I have to be extra gentle with handling it), battery life feels almost worse if not the same, battery percentage no longer shows on upper right corner (no option to change either), you have to swipe down to see it, and the price tag. As each day goes by, my feeling is the same... that I’ll be returning the phone within my 14-day timeframe. Luckily, I still have my 6s Plus to go back to (whew!). Now that’s a great phone. I’ll give 3 stars because the X is not a bad phone, but it’s also not the best phone - for me (and I’m a huge tech-fanatic). This is one case where the newer isn’t better. But always an Apple fan!"
718,5,I love that the iPhone finally has no home button and wireless charging! Best Buy service is great service and helped me every step of the way!
719,5,I JUST LOVE THE SMALL VERSION OF THIS IPHONE WITH THE SAME SCREEN QUALITY AS A PLUS LITTLE BIGGER I SHOULD SAY BUT ALL IN ALL GREAT
720,5,"It’s everything you love about the IPhone with a few more bells and whistles. Face recognition scanning, Better gaming graphics, the screen looks amazing with added Samsung OLED technology, and really with no headphone jack really doesn’t matter (if don’t have a Bluetooth headset get one. It’s 2017!) . Camera really takes great pictures. I’ve liked the way IPhone has done things for the last 10 yrs, and this a brilliant Design and has amazing battery life. It’s not a customizable as Android phones, if your into that check out the Samsung line up."
721,5,I really love it. It is confusing to use at first day but after I learn fast. It also is the most expensive iPhone ever. I bought the space gray 256MB. The customer service at Manassas Bestbuy is very friendly and helpful. Thank you.
722,5,"I’m so happy to have this phone, I’m very please with it"
723,5,I love ❤ it!! It is simple to use and different at the same time..
724,5,It’s a spectacular upgrade. Apple raises the bar again.
725,5,The I phone x feels completely like a different phone. I love the facial unlocking. I love the swiping apps. I do love the fact that the button is gone and have fewer steps to open. I love how my life proof case fits the x. The look it has. The screen is larger than bigger phones. I just love it.
726,5,"While I was ready for an updated iPhone since my 6+ the reviews made me hesitate. All poppy cock! You will not miss the home button or the frame surrounding the screen. In fact, not only do you gain more screen real estate than a plus the iPhone X is narrower and fits easier in the palm of your hand! Furthermore, the face recognition feature is faster and more natural to navigate than the home button. I adjusted to the change in less than a minute. Sexy to hold, navigate and see with a camera/photos that will blow you away. Joy to the world. Thank-you Apple!!! LOVE!"
727,5,Love my new phone it’s amazing Best Buy is awesome would recommend to anybody sales people very friendly I will always return
728,5,"What a great phone, the best that I ever had"
729,5,"Took a hot minute to get used to the navigation, but the corner to corner screen is awesome! The phones battery is the best any iPhone has had, it’s sleek, and the processor is faster as well. Glad I purchased this over the 8 or 8 plus."
730,5,"The phone is easy to use, I definitely smaller than my 7plus. The X screen is bigger and the camera omg, the camera is Aaaaaamazing!!!!!! I love the portrait mode there’s nothing like it."
731,5,"I didn’t know if I would like it with being smaller than the plus, but the screen size definitely makes up for it! The swipe instead of the button is so much efficient, the Face ID is the best, The battery life is great, the camera is amazing - I cannot complain!"
732,4,"I was super content with my old 5s and had no intention of upgrading, but very Glad I did. The picture quality is amazing!! Same similar functions as the old phone so it’s very easy to use, if you are familiar with the iPhone."
733,5,"I wasn't sure I wanted this new phone until I was having trouble with my 7,but the retina scanning is the most amazing this I have seen in a while. It really works well and is so hassle free when it comes to using the phone. This is jus one of the many features I love, the other is the sharpness of the new camera. Well done Apple!"
734,5,Nice phone. Takes some getting used to no home button. New learning curve.
735,5,I thought not having the home button would be a problem but swiping was easy to adapt to. Face recognition works well.
736,5,Great phone so far. Fairly reliable Face ID that works with most apps.
737,5,"This is the first upgrade that really makes it worh your while. Face ID works flawlessly and the new OLED screen is amazing. The battery life has definitely improved as well. And as always it’s a sleek, modern design. I would definitely recommend it! I bought the silver one and it looks great."
738,5,"I really love my phone and trully love the bestbuy.,"
739,4,"I have been using iphone for about 8 years. This is the best phone ever. I have used samsung galaxy for three times and i switched back to iphone no matter what. The last iphone i had was iphone 8plus. I loved it because of the big screen and fast and stylish. Those plus sizes are so big in my hand. I wanted to try iphone x and got the iphone x. I instantly love it, its small yet its big screen. The weight is light and its easy to hold the phone. However, there is one problem. It freezes!! Sometimes, i called a person and i couldnt hear. I had to turn on speaker to talk. I had to restart the phone to get normal. Sometimes im on web page, its stuck in there. This is the only issue i have. Other than that, this is thr best iphone in iphone generation."
740,5,Love face recognition and camera. No home button was a bit of an adjustment.
741,5,This iPhone is amazing..the full screen is awesome and the colors are vibrant! There is not a single thing on this phone I do not like! Highly recommend it!
742,5,"I really love this iPhone!! It took a little getting used to and how to work things. But once you do, it’s great!!"
743,5,"Amazing camera, beautiful phone, great features, love the face recognition."
744,5,The screen itself is enough to blow other iPhones out of the water. The user interface is excellent and quickly responsive. Can’t got wrong with this purchase.
745,5,This Thanksgiving I purchased the latest iPhone X. The iPhone is really great. I got great deal in buying the iPhone at best buy and also they have good amount of stock when there is waiting list in market and the service I received at best buy is good.
746,5,This is an awesome phone especially face recognition.
747,5,"Coming from the IPhone 7, I can appreciate the larger screen. I love the hands free Siri as well as the facial recognition feature."
748,5,"This new iPhone X is great. Easy to access apps, camera is great, and makes ch quicker response time."
749,1,"Maybe I got a lemon, but the phone is completely unusable after less than a week of ownership. Screens switch back and forth at will and apps randomly open and close. I've read it could be from the screen being put on incorrectly at the manufacturer. For this much money, it should work!"
750,5,Best phone I ever had I love the no home button
751,4,Great phone so far. The new features work as advertised.
752,5,"Really like the face ID feature. Worked great with glasses and in the dark. Also, liked the new changes to the IOS and also seems to handle most apps and games."
753,5,This phone is a different way to use iOS. Once you get used to it you will never go back
754,5,My purchase was very easy and staff was very helpful
755,5,My wife upgraded her iPhone 6 Plus and never looked back. iPhone X is perhaps the most advanced smartphone there is.
756,5,Love that the actual phone is smaller but the screen is bigger.
757,5,This new iPhone is great. I love the added screen size to the regular phone body that this model has.
758,5,The X is everything I asked for in a phone! It’s easy to use and all my info transferred over without any problems!
759,1,Had this phone delivered 11/3. Immediately went into a good case. It has never been dropped or even laid down hard. I noticed about 2 weeks ago the glass over the rear camera has a small crack in it ( does not effect pics). Apple says it is physical damage and wants to charge me 500 + to fix. Theres not a single mark of any kind on the phone. I have always enjoyed apple products and own many. But this will be the last iPhone for me. I expected better for a 1149.00 phone.
760,4,"The new iPhone X met my expectations in every way, the swiping functions worked great and you can move from app to app easier than ever."
761,5,Got this IPHONE X as an upgrade for my elderly mother. She loves the big screen...easier for her older eyes to see stuff
762,5,"This is by far the best phone on the market. I don’t like that there isn’t a 128gig option anymore but I wasn’t about to get the 64g. I haven’t had it long, so still adjusting to the new gestures, but this phone is awesome! Love the new camera!"
763,5,I love the new iPhone. The camera is amazing. Easy to use.
764,5,"Received the ten on launch day, it took a couple days to get use to but overall I was satisfied. It wasn't until I had to use my 7 Plus again to reset it that I really noticed a difference; the 7 Plus seemed old. The gestures of the ten really make the 7 Plus seemed as if it came out 3-4 years ago and not one. The battery is better than I thought and what many have told me, the phone is a little thicker and heavier than my previous but you get use to it quickly. Overall I'm very happy and would recommend."
765,5,Features are a plus and I learn of new ones everyday. The size is a positive but screen size is same as larger phones.
766,5,The sliding up takes some getting use to without having the home button but I think it’s been a great upgrade!
767,5,Love the phone but the only real benefit of the iPhone X over the 8 is the OLED screen. Face recognition is nice but isn’t worth buying alone. Most apps don’t take advantage of the larger screen yet and crop it to the same size as if you had an 8
768,5,"Great phone, just wish they sokly have made a plus also"
769,5,The iPhone X is worth it. Both my brothers have it. I did a lot of research to find out if it was worth the extra money. I upgraded from the iPhone 6s. In the back of my mind I was thinking about trying it out for a day or two then taking it back. I will not be taking it back this phone is awesome.
770,4,"Love the IPhone X. Upgraded from an IPhone 6 Plus. I was worried about the home key going away, but it is no problem. The phone is very easy to use. Just hate the price tag, more than my first car!"
771,5,Love the feel. New size and screen a plus. No button getting comfortable.
772,5,My phone is terrific. I love that has all features
773,5,Wished it had a home button and it keeps freezing up a lot
774,4,"I bought as a gift, you need to learn a lot for the new operation"
775,5,This phone is amazing and very happy with my purchase.
776,4,I was really pleased that I held out for the Iphone X. The camera is so much better and the photos look like they have been taken on a DSLR. My only quibbles are the battery life and the price. Hopefully the battery life will be improved with IOS updates.
777,5,"Bought this for my husband who is a big Apple fan like me. He decided he wanted one when I received my iPhone X and showed him the new features. We love the Animoji, the fast processor, the phone size (we’ve always had the Plus models since they first came out and the size of this thing is awesome - fits your hand and pocket better, and the screen is still big enough for optimal viewing), the camera (even the selfies come out so clear). It’s pricey yes but he’s happy so I’m happy."
778,5,"I’ve only had this phone for a few days but I already am in love with it. They sound like feature works really well, much better than I thought it would. It took me a little getting used to on where everything is Changed such as there’s no home button, Notification Center has changed, etc. overall though I am thoroughly enjoying the face unlock feature. Some of the AR features are a lot of fun using me clips app. The screen also is quite stellar looking, much better than my iPhone 8+ screen."
779,5,"Love my iPhone X! Great graphics, user friendly, camera is amazing!"
780,3,"The phone itself wasn't bad at all. It had a lot of things that Apple should of had a long time ago. Nice Camera, Screen, plus pretty fast. I have issue with the lip on the top part of the screen. Two thirds of the top of the screen is used up. Which to me makes so it should be able to be counted in total screen realestate. It should really just say it is a 5.5 inch screen plus side burns. I took it back and switched back to my Note 8."
781,5,I am loving my new iPhone. It takes unbelievable pictures and video. Still getting used to no home button but I love that it doesn’t have one so I can have more screen.
782,5,"Animojis are a hoot, and fill size screen with crystal clear resolution are great."
783,5,Great upgrade from the iPhone 6 that I had. Photo quality is superb and new features are awesome.
784,5,"Nice looking phone, took some time getting used to all the features it offers. A tad bit on the expensive side though."
785,5,I was Leary about getting a new phone but this thing is worth the leap!
786,5,I had a very pleasant experience at Best Buy mobile. The sales attendant was very helpful and he was very nice. It didn’t take very long and an easy process.
787,5,The Face ID is worth the upgrade on its own. Plus having a smaller phone than the plus with an even slighter larger screen is no brainer to me. Have not found anything to complain about yet with the phone. Battery life is great as well.
788,5,"I upgraded from the 7 plus to the X and was initially concerned about the difference in size. Much to my surprise, the sleekness of this phone is very nice. I don’t even miss the larger size."
789,5,I love this iPhone!! Apple finally got rid of the screen border. Only negative is wish it came with AirPods:( Oh Well!! My husband loves his new IPhone X too!!
790,5,"Everything processes so much quicker than previous phones. Also, the facial recognition is fun and again speeds up the unlocking of the phone."
791,4,I think it is too early to buy this phone...especially as the price is so high. Not particularly impressed off the bat. I was expecting much better speed but have been disappointed so far. Facial recognition is not worth the hype...at least from my limited use.
792,5,"I love the larger screen size on this phone, camera quality is amazing, and the facial recognition is convenient. There are so many features that are new compared to my older version. I do think the price is high."
793,2,If you love your iPhone you’ll hate this phone. The size is great but the phone is terrible
794,5,"Easy to use, love the new update and the camera! The portrait camera feature quality is like taking pictures from a high end expensive camera!"
795,5,Worth the investment. It’s face recognition is exceptional
796,5,"Daughter loves IPhone. So we waited for Christmas. She works hard and needs,a phone she can rely on for safety reasons. It's something apple create is a classic reliable phone. Thank you."
797,3,the phone is smaller than previous versions even if it takes full screen
798,5,The iPhone X is legit. Great service from Best Buy setting it up and getting me a great deal as well!
799,5,The folks at the Oxford Valley kiosk store were fabulous. Very patient . Will only buy from them
800,5,"Best phone out right now when it comes to simplicity and if you want to be apart of the future if Apple, GET IT!"
801,5,"The iPhone X is the first full screen iPhone and it lives up to the hype. The display is of quality and the new front camera system with Face ID is awesome. Pricey, but you pay for quality!!!"
802,3,"$1.8K for a phone? I could build a great computer, buy a laptop or go on a great trip with that kind of money. But your are not here for that reason. You want to know whether the phone is worth the money and my answer is No. It's a great phone! but here's the thing, it's not worth the money. You are essentially getting an iPhone 8 plus in a smaller form factor. It's slower to use as the FaceID is still new and it's a 3 step process to unlock you phone instead of the 1 step to unlock with TouchID. Closing apps is a big pain in the but as you have to wait a few seconds to bring up the tabs and the hold again for a few seconds to bring up the close app icon. At least you know you won't turn off you phone accidentally though! it requires 2 buttons :P Screen is nice but viewing angle is not great compared to LCDs. The camera is super great! I love it for both video and photo. The call quality is pretty rubbish, where people on the receiving end hear you like you are living under water. Your mouth actually has to be almost touching the microphone area. Hopefully Apple figures this issue out asap as that's the primary function of the device. P.S. FaceID works with sunnies and in the dark ;) I'd say wait until next year where Apple has covered some R&D costs on the new form factor and lower the price of the new gen iphone."
803,5,The camera it’s better than I expected and the no home button took getting use to but love it now..
804,5,So far so good. Best iPhone so far. Face recognition to unlock is actually pretty cool.
805,5,"This is the the best phone, love the new feature and most of all the facial recognition!!!! Great gift for your love ones."
806,4,"My new iPhone X is a really neat phone and I haven’t even discovered everything it can do yet. My only complaints are that it’s sometimes slow, it freezes, and the facial recognition doesn’t always work and never in the dark."
807,4,"Not so much different from the previous version, only face recognition is the new feature!"
808,5,iPhones get better and better. Now I want an iPhone X plus (when it comes out)
809,5,So far this is one of the best iPhone Apple has came out with! It’s a little different without the home button but learning about the new features is even better!
810,5,I love my iPhone X. The home button not being there was different but not bad.
811,5,"So far so good! Easy to go from 6S to the X. Fast, clear and bright screen. Much better photos!"
812,5,Glad I upgraded. Would have gotten 3 if they weren’t so expensive
813,5,"This smartphone is the best phone I’ve ever used - the speed, camera and capacity is robust."
814,5,Never knew getting rid of the home button would change my life.
815,5,Great phone best one I had yet upgraded from a iPhone 6
816,5,From the moment i bought it i loved it. I thought the phone being smaller was going to be a problem but the total opposite.
817,5,Best iPhone ever. Takes some getting used to as there is no home button. So much easier without one.
818,5,The iPhone X is a great phone. Facial recognition works flawlessly.
819,5,A little scared at first I got the 256gb and was unsure if I would like it but it’s awesome Face ID is a life saver no more will my finger read it works 100 out of 100 and got to love the screen and wireless charging IPhone for life !!!!!
820,5,I love the new iPhone no home button is nice just have to look at it and it unlocks
821,5,"We were long overdue for upgrades, decided to see what all the hype was about. Bye bye Samsung, hello IPhone 10 (X) 256GB. All we can say is WOW! Bought 2, a little pricey but very impressed with the looks, feel and features. Absolutely no regrets!"
822,5,"Fantastic phone, advanced in all the ways you might expect from a brand new generation of iPhone."
823,5,The camera is fantastic and all the little things that people are complaining about being changed are barely noticeable after a day of using the phone all the gestures feel natural and the notch just kind of blends away after a day
824,3,Phone not worth the 1000 it cost small screen slow not what I expected not wowed
825,5,After reading reviews and unsure of the the face recognition and no home button I made the leap! Not sorry! Phone operates seamlessly and love the new features...
826,5,I love the camera and the facial recognition that comes standard with this phone.
827,5,Since I’ve had my iPhone X everything has worked properly nothing has went wrong up to date and no bugs.
828,5,Upgraded from the iPhone 6 and I absolutely love it.
829,5,The phone is awesome it gives you the capability of performing numerous task seemlessly.
830,5,"Great screen and perfect size. Not as bulky as a plus. Camera is great, as good as my dslr."
831,5,"Just got my iPhone X and I can not believe how nice it is. I thought it would be hard to get used to not having a home button, it is not! And face recognition it works and it’s great! Best iPhone yet!"
832,5,I was not a fan of it at first but the camera is definitely so much better glad I bought it
833,5,This iPhone has the best camera. I am so happy with my purchase.
834,4,Bought the iPhone X for the camera since it's rated #2 by DXO Mark. I was hella disappointed when there's barely light in the room and the flash kicks in. It ruins the pictures with red eyes. That for me was enough not to keep it. Very disappointed
835,5,"This phone is absolutely amazing with an amazing camera. The detail is perfect. I upgraded my phone in time for a trip to Iceland and was beyond impressed by the pictures. The phone is very user friendly as usual and the extras like facial recognition are a nice added feature. The “notch” took some getting used to, but I don’t even notice it anymore. I do wish I could put the battery percentage on the battery again, but it’s not a huge deal."
836,5,"I love my iPhone X, works great I have it for a month now."
837,4,I am really impressed with my new IPhone X. It is definitely an upgrade from my IPhone 6 Plus
838,5,Very satisfied with my purchase. Camera is the best
839,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6s to the iPhone X and I love everything about it! Very easy to use. Highly recommend it!
840,5,The iPhone X 64G works like a great phone with less memory.
841,5,The iPhone X is a very intuitive phone. Easy transition!
842,5,"I love this phone! I refused to buy an iPhone plus as they are just too large and impractical for me but I felt I was missing out on some of their great features then YAY! The iPhone X came along with it’s dual cameras and full screen viewing in a manageable size. There are a few quirks to work out and I would love to see them make it compatible with the Apple Pencil but other than that, I couldn’t be happier!"
843,5,Decided to pass on the 7 and the 8 and go straight to the X and could not have been happier. The camera is AMAZING for a mobile phone and the added haptics make the phone feel like it has buttons even tho we’re now home button Free. Only complain is i can’t see my battery percentage (or turn it on anymore for that matter since the feature has been removed) unless i go to the Notification Center.
844,5,The new iphone. Has been a great purchase. The camera is awesome and the larger screen ya the best
845,5,"Lots of new futures, can not wait to explore more !"
846,5,"Thw iPhone x is a perfect upgrade, buttons are now part of the past just like cassette tapes"
847,5,We purchased this phone for our son. He loves it. He upgraded from an IPhone 7.
848,3,Good product but after using it for a week I returned it due to the lack of a home button and the multi-step process to close apps. Probably needs some tweaks to the software before I would reconsider. Much happier with my IPhone 8+.
849,5,I bought the iPhone X about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Face ID is amazing and I love how easy Apple pay is to use
850,5,Great phone. Good improvement over the iphone 7. Screen is amaizing.
851,5,Facial recognition works fine - not worried about storage ( 256 g) Glass protector and otter box - All doing just what they advertised !!!
852,5,IPhone X so much better than the IPhone 5. Facial Recognition is so cool and the new screen size from edge to edge is perfect. Larger screen and yet it still fits in my pocket. I bought it in the Capitola Mall Best Buy Store with help from Vanessa T. She was the best!!! I hated going to the AT&T store but Best Buy was great!
853,4,"I must admit, I am that guy that gets each new iPhone. They string me in every time! So being someone that has been through every version, I can honestly say this is my favorite iteration of the phone, ever. This is by far, the best iPhone! It’s fast, the screen is beautiful, and the facial recognition works amazingly. Many complain about that small bump that takes up real estate from the screen. It did bother me at first. After 2 weeks, I don’t seem to notice it anymore. My only complaint is the fingerprint reader unlocked everything faster. I didn’t even need to lift the phone. The facial recognition does work great, but you have to have your face right in front of it. I cant really consider that a flaw, seeing as that is what the phone intends to do. Overall, the phone is worth the money!"
854,5,Way more crisp and clear than last. Facial recognition is amazing and better than expected.
855,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 7 and I love it this phone is amazing
856,4,Got this for my wife and she adores it.. water proof stylish and amazing camera.. it's apple so storage sucks
857,5,Love the phones capabilities and the camera... must have
858,5,Best iPhone made by apple till date. Face ID works better than most people expected.
859,5,"I was skeptical about the lack of Home button and while it took me some time to get used to it, it is very easy to use. It makes the phone extremely seamless. At first, I thought Face ID wasn’t very accurate. It would not recognize me if my hair was pulled back or if i had glasses on. It learns your face. The more you use it, the more accurate it becomes. It even recognizes me in the dark. The camera is out of this world. Absolutely love it."
860,5,This is my first iPhone and I’m in love!!! Love the FaceTime app too
861,5,Switched from android and will never go back! Camera is awesome and love the face recognition!
862,5,"Best iPhone ever. Super fast, fantastic camera and elegant."
863,5,"Once you get use to the edge to edge screen you simply won’t be able to go back to the boxy old screens with big black block frames, no wasted screen space!"
864,4,"I have had my first iPhone for 2 weeks, the X. I love the processing speed and have been getting used to the operating procedures. The only mysterious/troublesome item so far is the sudden, unexplained loss of callers voices during a phone call. I've tried to find a ""mute"" button or switch, in case I accidentally pushed one, but have not been successful. ? ? ? Until I find the solution, I can't fully recommend the phone yet."
865,4,I really like the camera and sound system for the iPhone X. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my sister who is NOT a twin could unlock my phone using the face scanner!!
866,5,Very worth while for the price you put in for the phone
867,5,"I had ZERO desire to get he iPhone X, but when I went in to trade-in my iPhone 7 I fell in love with it. The colors are vibrant and the new gestures are easy to get used to."
868,5,This phone is exactly what I expected from Apple..
869,5,Fantastic iPhone yet. I would recommend anyone this phone over any previous apple iPhone product.
870,5,It was so amazing! So fast! The camera is amazing it was so pretty too
871,4,Love it. Face ID is a much needed feature. No complaints
872,5,"I love the IPhone X, it is easy to use once you get the hang of it. Easy to hold in your hand, and a little bit bigger to see it better. I really like the face recognition, so easy. Can’t wait to use it to take pictures and see the difference it makes."
873,5,The iPhone X is great. I love the Face ID and the size of the phone is perfect for my smaller hands.
874,5,"Possibly the best phone I have ever had! I thought it wasn’t really geared towards business, BUT it’s for everything! I am very glad I purchased this over the competition."
875,5,So far the best Iphone cristal clear pictures slim design amazing...!!
876,5,"Best iPhone yet a must have very happy with it,and going to purchase another."
877,5,"Awesome phone, and the staff at Best Buy was great."
878,2,I have mixed reviews. While the display and added features are awesome...I’m concerned about bringing back the glass on both sides design. I understand the need for the glass for wireless charging but if apple isn’t going to include a wireless charger why bother? I’m also a bit annoyed with the removal of the headphone jack. An adapter is provided but now you have to choose between using headphones or charging your phone. The alternative would be to buy wireless headphones (which are not included).
879,5,"This phone is amazing. It’s fast, sleek and classy. The technology hands down is way better than my 6+."
880,5,"Nice build , good feel to the phone . Like it much better than the i7 better design .."
881,5,Phone is great larger screen without having a big phone.
882,3,I miss my Plus. The only feature i like on this is the facial recognition
883,5,Best phone I’ve gotten so far . Wish it was bigger but overall love it
884,5,"I was skeptical about purchasing this iPhone, but I’m glad I did, one can finally do everything needed with one hand including purchases with the face time feature. No more buttons, button are now Dinasour’s when it comes to mondern day Technology."
885,5,"Bought the new IPhone X and Love it! When I first went in to Best Buy they were out , so the sales person told me there was a shipment coming in the next day. He was very helpful....the next morning I called and 1 came in and it had my name on it ."
886,5,"Slim, sleek and sweet. Awesome phone with best of both iPhones regular and plus."
887,5,The new iPhone X is amazing. Great features. Love it
888,5,Love the phone. Will continue to buy iPhones!! Great product!
889,5,Love apple products. Best phone I ever had. Love the facial recognition
890,5,This is one of the best iPhones out there recommend the sound is phenomenal with stereo speaker type sound.
891,5,Went from the 7 plus to IPhone X. The phone is smaller but packs a lot of power. I love the camera and face recognition. I don’t miss the bigger phone at all.
892,5,Great phone love the new design and also great cam
893,4,"I do like the size of the screen, not too small or large. Glass is easily scratched. I like the no home button. Phone looks really clean."
894,5,Definitely takes some getting used to but overall I like the X. Amazing pics and fast processor. Love the animal taking emojis.
895,5,Most functional of all other generations of iPhones. No complaints so far!
896,5,"I can’t say how much I love this phone, I kind miss the wider screen that the 7plus had but I got so used to typing with one hand that I don’t think i would downgrade from this"
897,5,So far the IPhone X has been great. I couldn’t believe I walked into Best Buy and they had the phones in stock.
898,5,Best ever!!! Love this so much and it’s easy to get used to
899,5,"Great phone. Facial recognition works well, no problems. I recommend upgrading."
900,5,I love the fact that this phone has the display size of the plus models but is just slightly bigger than the 9+ Morales. Love the gesture features in the facial ID
901,5,Very pretty IPhone X is the best phone around the world
902,5,"There are many choices, but Shanel was a great help to me in making the right choice for me. I am enjoying exploring all the great features of my new phone!"
903,5,So sleek and fast. Definitely happy with my purchase. The Face ID is my favorite feature and the photos are great quality.
904,5,Easy to get used to swiping without home button. Much faster than 6 plus I had.
905,5,"6.3 inch screen in the future will be amazing, but this new iPhone X is great , Face ID is better than Touch ID. The OLED panel can stay toe to toe with the Note 8. Only down side is the screen aspect ratio, once all apps are optimized with The iPhone X watching vids will be one of the best!"
906,5,This is a great phone. The camera blows all other iPhones away.
907,5,"Loving the phone so far. Held up a picture I took and sent to my gf, held her 7 next to the X and the difference in clarity was inszne."
908,5,"The design and build of the iPhone X is by far, the best of 2017. iOS 11 run fantasticly. Hard to justify the price though. I bought it outright and it maybe not be worth it. Anyone getting it on contract this is a smart buy"
909,4,"I love the idea of not having a home button. It is fast and efficient. At times it does not recognize my face, which can be annoying but other than that it’s great."
910,5,This is the best IPhone ever. It’s so easy to use and the safety of the Face ID is phenomenal.
911,5,This is the best phone hands down can’t beat it perfect phone
912,5,Phone is great. The screensize is life changing and the lack of home button hasn’t been an issue for day to day use
913,3,"No home button sucks! Buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which is more powerful."
914,5,Camera exceeds expectations with megapixels and mores.
915,5,It is the best iPhone that I have. Take nice pictures and I love the size.
916,4,"Great: Screen, haptic feedback, build, design Notch isnt a distraction Not so great: The notification centre, takes face id time to get better"
917,4,"Just bought this phone for my wife, she's always had apple. You know what to expect with IPhone, her o my complaint is minor, you can't view the battery percentage anymore you have to go to settings to see that. The camera is great."
918,4,Had the phone for about 2 wks and so far so good. Love the new interactions and the camera is awesome.
919,5,Best iphone by a great company Best Buy thanks for having it in stock
920,5,Really like the smooth lines and no home button...
921,4,Awesome ph with a very nice screen to body ratio. Feels gr8 in hand though not one hand manageable. I felt this is very fragile and need a bulky case in order to protect the piece which will take away the beauty of the ph which we are paid for. Should have touch is in my view.
922,5,There was great improvement in the new update for the Iphone. The facial recognition is great and works in near dark situations. The size is just right as its not too big as the Plus models have been recently. I would recommend this for someone looking for the most up to date technology.
923,5,Apple always does a great job. Works great and the new features are outstanding
924,5,Bought this iPhone for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Best iPhone on the market right now.
925,5,"Best iPhone I’ve ever had, hands down. I wouldn’t have any other iPhone."
926,5,"I love my new iPhone X! It takes great pictures, it is very fast the battery life is a lot better than any previous iPhones I’ve owned(from 4s till now)"
927,5,"Love this phone, I have no negatives, using the Face ID is like butter, so smooth!"
928,5,iPhone X has everything you need plus a whole lot more!
929,5,Love it smaller but large who knew. Very clean and fast
930,4,Liking this phone a lot so far!!! Best Buy was amazing and had it for us right away!!!
931,5,iphone is the best I've had since the first one. Customer service was great too
932,5,Love my new iPhone! Battery is great new features are awesome!
933,5,Great phone. Does everything I wanted it to do anymore and I love the memory space I have it
934,5,"If you’re considering buying, just do it! You won’t be disappointed!"
935,5,I bought this for myself and I love it and the improvemed camera so I bought another one as an Xmas gift for my wife
936,5,Have been an Apple product fan for a long time. The newest iteration of the iPhone certainly doesn’t disappoint!!
937,5,Smaller than my 7+ but the screen size is perfect. Easy to hold and operate. Sales rep who helped was awesome and patient
938,5,I love my iPhone X. It’s amazing! Highly recommend it
939,5,Just wonder! I’ve been using this phone for almost two months now and this thing phenomenal. The screen is beautiful! Battery life has been improved considerably. I had the iPhone 6s and upgraded to the iPhone 6s Plus because the battery was terrible on the smaller version of the phone so I was a bit skeptical of what the battery life would be like on a phone that is almost the same size as the 4.7 inch iPhone 6s. To my delight it lasts longer than my plus model!
940,5,I really like the Animoji and AR capabilities. Face recognition is a nice touch to the iPhone lineup.
941,5,Awesome Phone. Another great product put out by Apple.
942,5,Very good. Preactically. Awesome. Fun and great fittures
943,5,Upgrading from an 6s and wow this is fast. It takes awhile to learn the new gestures without a home button but other then that I can’t complain.
944,5,Absolutely love that the screen is still as large or slightly larger than my plus but the overall phone is smaller! Very sleek design. Excellent camera!!
945,5,By far the best iPhone so far. Do not miss the home button.
946,5,I spent a lot of time on YouTube trying to figure out whether to do an iPhone 8+ or the iPhone X Find me they seemed very close and I had enough of a gift certificate to close the price gap and boy am I glad. Find me they seemed very close and I had enough of a gift certificate to close the price And boy am I glad. As usual the staff at Best Buy for knowledgeable friendly and took the time with me as I was still on the fence when I walked in. Best Buy no place like it. iPhone X what can I say!
947,5,Great phone. Worth the upgrade from my iPhone 7. !
948,5,"Super sleek, easy to use, only thing that I feel could use more work is on the facial recognition software."
949,5,This phone is just...wow! The new features are amazing and though not necessarily worth the price tag still make me happy every time I use it!
950,5,"This is the best iteration of the iphone since it’s inception. It’s a nod to the original but includes all of the next gen tech such as wireless charging, edge-to-edge display, and an OLED display. Would definitely recommend this device."
951,5,"Although if it’s pretty exprensive, I think it’s worth the price. Upgraded from iphone 6s plus"
952,5,"Phone is fast, pictures are extremely clear and detailed. Features are perfect"
953,5,Lifelong iPhone user. It has been an easy transition to the new iPhone X. Have used it for several weeks and have enjoyed it immensely.
954,5,This phone is a nice upgrade from the 7 series phones. From the upgraded camera to facial recognition this phone has got it all.
955,5,"Great phone, lives up to all of the excitement built around it!"
956,5,"been meaning to try the I phone for a few years, finally decided to make the switch and so far have been satisfied. still a lot to learn. plan to get some tips on its operation."
957,5,"Super fast, great screen and love the FaceID. The lack of a home button is not an issue like I thought it may be."
958,5,Love my new Apple iPhone X. I have small hands and it fits perfectly. I needed a larger screen I could see but the Plus iPhones were a little too wide to fit comfortably in my hand. The X meets but my needs!
959,5,I bought the Apple watch series 3 and the iPhone X on the same day. Both products live up to every inch of their advertisements. I have never owned a phone with so many features and capabilities with such ease of operation. So do yourself a favor and make your life easier..........go get the iphone X. You won't be disappointed!
